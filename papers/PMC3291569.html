<p>All <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains used are derivatives of MG1655 and JH642, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002549.s005">Table S1</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> was cultured in Luria Bertani medium (LB), LB+0.2% glucose, or AB minimal medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Clark1">[62]</xref> supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, 10 &#181;g/ml thiamine, and 5 &#181;g/ml thymidine. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was cultured in LB or minimal S7<sub>50</sub>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Jaacks1">[63]</xref> with 1% glucose and the appropriate amino acid supplements. Unless otherwise stated, cultures were started from overnight grown cells, diluted to an OD of 0.005, grown to an OD 0.2&#8211;0.6, diluted again to an OD of 0.005, grown to an OD of &#8764;0.3 for further study.</p><p>This was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Weart1">[34]</xref>. Openlab's density slice module was employed to determine cellular cross-sectional area. Data was corroborated by staining cells with the membrane dye FM4-64 (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 1 &#181;m/mL and calculating area through length-by-width measurements.</p><p>
<italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of &#8764;0.3, treated with sodium azide (300 &#181;g/ml; Fluka BioChemika) and lysed. DNA proximal to the origin (<italic>oriC</italic>) or terminus (<italic>ter</italic>) was amplified by qPCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002549.s006">Table S2</xref> for oligonucleotide sequences) and results analyzed using the Pfaffl method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Pfaffl1">[64]</xref>. Marker ratios were normalized to the <italic>ori/ter</italic> ratio of either <italic>E. coli</italic> cells treated with rifampicin (300 &#181;g/ml; Sigma) and cephalexin (36 &#181;g/ml; Sigma) or DNA prepared from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Setlow1">[65]</xref>. Treatment with chloramphenicol (200 &#181;g/ml; Sigma) for 4+ hours was used for replication run-out in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>Flow cytometry was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Ferullo1">[66]</xref> and origins per cell were calculated using the Cell Quest Pro software and processed in Microsoft Excel.

<italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains either encoding a <italic>lac</italic> operator array near the origin with an inducible source of <italic>lacI</italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, or carrying a fluorescent protein fused to a replisome component, have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Gordon1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-ReyesLamothe1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Lemon1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Lee1">[46]</xref>. Cells were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.25&#8211;0.35, stained with FM4-64, and placed on an agarose pad. Cells were scored for number of distinct foci.</p><p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The initiation age (a<sub>i</sub>) was calculated by flow cytometry using the following formula: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" ns0:href="pgen.1002549.e009.jpg" /></inline-formula>, 0&#8805;<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>&#8805;1; where <italic>F</italic> is equal to the fraction of uninitiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Wold1">[68]</xref>. The initiation age was then applied to a distribution of cellular areas to calculate the cell size at initiation. Cell size measured by cross-sectional area correlated well with cell mass measurement by optical density of the culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002549-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Experiments were performed essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Weart2">[49]</xref>. Briefly, lysates from cultures grown to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.25&#8211;0.35 were normalized to either optical density (600 nm) or cell number (determined using a hemocytometer) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed using either <italic>E. coli</italic> rabbit anti-DnaA antibody (the gift of Jon Kaguni) or <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chicken anti-DnaA antibody (the gift of Alan Grossman), and cognate goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch). DnaA levels were determined relative to FtsZ in individual strains using ImageQuant software and plotted in Microsoft Excel 2008.</p><p>Cells containing pDS596 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002549-Hwang1">[48]</xref>, a low-copy plasmid with an arabinose inducible copy of <italic>dnaA</italic>, were cultured in LB and back-diluted &#177; arabinose without ampicillin. These strains were evaluated by flow cytometry, marker frequency analysis, and quantitative immunoblotting as described above.</p>
