bhk21 american type culture collection  were cultivated at thirtyseven c 5 co2 in one hundred cm2 plates under twelve ml of dulbecco modified eagles minimum essential medium dmem supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum and passaged upon confluence the vsv infectious cdna used to obtain population a was kindly provided by g t w wertz university of alabama united states of america 23
 
a 100l volume of an appropriate dilution was added to sixty mm culture plates and cells were topped with dmem medium containing 04 agarose monolayers were stained at 1822 h postinoculation hpi with a solution of 2 crystal violet sigma  in 10 formaldehyde panreac 
 
approximately n zero  five  one hundred and three pfu were inoculated to c  one hundred and six bhk21 cells in twentyfive cm2 flasks incubated for twentyfour h and the supernatant was used to seed a new infection passage under the same conditions up to twentyfive passages viral population sizes at the end of each infection passages were approximately nf  five  one hundred and nine pfu the number of viral infectious cycles generations per passage was estimated from n 0 nf and c as previously described 39 giving 4 generations per passage

following protocols established in previous work 4143 we used growth rate assays to estimate fitness we seeded 5  one hundred and three pfu of each population into 105 bhk21 cells and incubated the culture until the population grew up to a titer of 107 pfuml ie 78 hpi from final and initial titers the growth rate r was calculated as the slope of logtiter regression against time hpi we defined fitness w as the number of descendants per individual per hour ie w  er  one point fitness assays were done in triplicate
 
viruses were plated as detailed above paying care to put less than fifty pfu per plate to avoid plaque overlapping all platings were done in a single block and the same overlay medium batch was used for both populations and staining was done at twentyfour hpi pictures of the plates were taken with a five megapixel canon powershot g5 digital camera  and image analysis was done with analysis v32 software soft imaging system  the vast majority of plaques were automatically identified whereas the rest were manually delineated in a zoomed image after defining plaques as single objects we automatically obtained their surface area in pixels s
 
to calibrate the relationship between plaque size and fitness we selected twelve clones from each population that widely varied in fitness and for each we determined the average plaque size from four independent plates since we had no evidence that fitness and plaque area were linearly related we performed a loglog regression to obtain a calibration line of the form logw  p  mlogs for population a we obtained m  one point nine zero seven  zero point three one eight and p  13785  two point two four six r  0884 whereas for population b we obtained m  zero point nine two seven  zero point zero nine six and p  5874  zero point six seven eight r  0950 the calibration line was used to transform each observed plaque size into a predicted fitness
 
although the calibrations described above seemed relatively accurate it is unavoidable that there was some degree of uncertainty and consequently no guarantee that no bias was introduced we therefore carried out a second analysis that bypassed the calibration step to achieve this we simply assumed that the number of lysed cells was proportional to the number of viruses produced first we estimated the number of lysed cells on a plaque d by dividing its pixel surface area per the total pixel surface area of the sixty mm plate and multiplying per the total number of cells on a plate which was obtained by counting cells in an hemocytometer neubauer second we estimated the average number of viruses produced per cell k by titrating a fully lysed plate this was done separately for populations a and b yielding k  2204  thirtytwo and k  2712  eightytwo respectively using these estimations plaque sizes were transformed into predicted fitness as wpred  kd124  one point the results obtained with this latter fitness estimation method unpublished data were consistent with those obtained using the calibration line population a showed higher maximum fitness and higher variance
 
standard growth rate assays were performed as described above except that in competitions between populations figure 3 only one hundred pfu from each competitor were inoculated to minimize the effect of rare beneficial mutations see below viruses from the two genotypes were inoculated into the same well genotype b carried a monoclonal antibody resistance marker that allowed us to estimate the titer of each population in the mixture by plating in presence and absence of antibody samples were taken at 0 7 8 9 10 11 12 15 20 25 and thirty hpi for competition with no mutagen for competitions in the presence of 5fu or 5azc cells had been pretreated with the indicated 5fu concentration twelve h prior infection samples were taken at 0 15 20 25 30 35 39 and fortynine hpi for twenty and forty gml 5fu and at 0 20 25 30 35 39 and fortynine hpi for eighty gml 5fu samples were taken at 0 10 12 15 24 28 32 38 and fortyeight hpi for five and 10gml 5azc and at 0 24 28 32 38 and fortyeight hpi for twenty gml 5azc growth rates for each population were calculated as the slope of the logtiter against hpi during the exponential growth phase for competitions between populations twelve replicates of the competition assay were done for each different mutagen dose whereas for competitions between clones three replicates were done for each dose and each of the four clone pairs
 
we reduced the initial inoculum to 100 pfu of each population to minimize the effect of rare beneficial mutations in the outcome of the competition since 1000 clones were sampled during the plaque size fitness screening the probability that beneficial mutations at a frequency f in the population went unnoticed during this screening is given by the binomial distribution function bi0 1000 f for each competition assay the probability that these beneficial mutations were present in the inoculum is one  bi0 100 f therefore for each replicate of the competition assay the joint probability that beneficial mutations that had been missed in the plaque size screening and were present in the competition assays is p  bi0 1000 f 1  bi0 100 f for all values of f p  zero point zero three five for each replica of the competition assay thus making it very unlikely that rare beneficial mutations had affected the results of the competition after twelve replicates
 
the expected outcome of a competition between population a and b based on plaque sizes was obtained as follows first to mimic the inoculum size of the real competition assays we randomly sampled a subset of one hundred individuals from each population and we got their expected progeny per hour which is equal to the predicted fitness we then let the simulated growth proceed until the total population size was similar to that observed at the last time point of real competitions the expected winner of the competition was the one with the larger progeny number at the final time point the random sampling and the simulation were repeated 1000 times
 
two random clones from populations a and b were picked from a sixty mm plate and stored at 80 c as ancestors twentyfour mutation accumulation lines were founded from each ancestor by randomly picking twentyfour lysis plaques following previous plaquetoplaque experimental designs 44 for each lineage viruses were plated and at twentyfour hpi a lysis plaque was randomly sampled resuspended in dmem medium and directly plated onto a fresh monolayer this protocol was pursued on a daily basis for12 passages the number of generations elapsed during each plaquetoplaque passage was estimated to be approximately two to obtain enough viruses for fitness assays the ancestors and the final derived clones were given a single passage in a 96well plate containing 104 bhk21 fitness assays were performed as detailed above simultaneously for the ancestors and the derived lines in three experimental blocks in each block the twentyfour derived clones of each population were assayed once whereas the ancestors were assayed six times
 
the expected change in logfitness after t generations t  24 is logw  logwt  logw zero  udtelog1  s the expected genetic variance for logfitness among lineages is g 2logwt  udtelog1  s2 and the total variance is t 2logw  e 2logw  g 2logw where subindex e refers to environmental variance since genetic variance is null for the ancestor and all fitness assays were performed in the same environmental conditions e 2logwt  e 2logw 0  t 2logw 0 and therefore g 2logwt  t 2logwt  t 2logw 0  t 2logw it follows that and that where  is the coefficient of variation standard deviation to mean ratio of log w associated to single deleterious mutations 1   2elog1  s and ud1   2 were directly estimated from the data
 
for an exponential distribution a simple and relatively accurate model for describing fitness effects associated to single mutations   one point nonetheless the actual distribution of mutational effects might have a heavier tail and thus a   one point a previous fitness dataset of twentyeight nonlethal random mutants of vsv 42 gave the empirical estimation   1598 using this figure we obtained estimates of ud and elog1  s and then of s for a   one point five nine eight should be an accurate estimation of the true value because it was obtained for the abovementioned fulllength infectious cdna clone it is possible however that due to its higher mutational robustness b showed a lower value this potential bias could account for the slightly higher ud estimate in b but it could not account for the nearly one order of magnitude difference in svalues in the extreme case b  0 the true ud b would be two point five nine eight times lower than our estimate and the true sb two point five nine eight times higher
 
to address whether differences between ud and s between a and b were statistically significant we generated 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates from both the twentyfour averaged fitness values of the derived clones and the six averaged fitness values of the ancestors after obtaining the corresponding 1000 pseudoreplicates of ud we counted the number of times ud was larger for a versus b and the same for s
 
parameters ud and s were also estimated using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the program mlgenomeu  in which a gamma distribution of the form gas  s  one e  s is used to describe the distribution of mutational effects s  28 following the authors recommendations we ran the program to estimate ud and  at fixed values varying from ninetynine to 001 the log likelihood monotonically increased as  decreased yielding increasingly higher values s   and ud  0
 
statistics were done with ms excel  and the spss twelve point zero package  resamplings and simulations were done using a perl script

the study population consisted of 2685 locally available randomly selected healthy subjects and transplant donors all research samples and data were collected according to the subjects guidelines and protocols of the local institutional review boards individuals with an unknown ethnical background were excluded from the analyses
 
dna was isolated using the local standard procedures used for hla typing genotyping of ten autosomally encoded minor h antigens and of hy was performed using the pcrssp technique invitrogen  the details of the minor h antigen typing methodology have been described before 37 previously typed cells from the centre detude du polymorphisme humainhuman genome diversity project cell line panel ceph panel and from the reference dna samples from the university of california los angeles international dna exchange program were used as controls all pcrssp samples were analyzed on agarose gel if the internal control pcrs failed for one of the two allele of a particular minor h antigen the typing for that minor h antigen was marked as incomplete and data were excluded from the analyses the alleles of each minor h antigen were reported as the amino acid resulting from the relevant snp typing data and sample parameters were submitted to a central online database 
 
typing data were analyzed at three levels 1 the allele frequency 2 genotype frequency and 3 phenotype frequencies allele and genotype frequencies except those of ugt2b17 were calculated by direct counting since the minor h antigen ugtb17 is the result of gene deletion the applied methodology did not allow detection of ugt2b17 heterozygosity therefore the ugt2b17 allele frequencies were estimated as for the nonimmunogenic allele and one  for the immunogenic allele where aa is the frequency of the nonimmunogenic phenotype the heterozygosity frequencies aa for this minor h antigen were estimated by two  1      assuming a hardyweinberg equilibrium
 
observed genotype frequencies were tested against hardyweinberg equilibrium the phenotype frequencies have been deduced from the genotype frequencies individuals who were homozygous or heterozygous positive for the immunogenic allele were regarded as phenotypically positive individuals carrying two nonimmunogenic alleles were marked as phenotypically negative since the hb1 minor h antigen has been demonstrated to be immunogenic in either direction phenotype frequencies have been calculated separately for the hb1h and the hb1y allele as immunogenic alleles the statistical significance of differences in allele genotype and phenotype frequencies between the various populations and geographic regions were determined by chisquare analysis the spss statistical software system spss 110  was used for these analyses pvalues lower than zero point zero five were considered statistically significant
 
linkage of the alleles of acc1 and acc2 was analyzed with the casecontrol haplotype inference chaplin software 34 individuals who were heterozygous for both acc1 and acc2 were classified as noninformative and excluded from the analysis
 
the disparity rate is defined as the chance of a putative transplant recipient with a minor h antigen immunogenic phenotype having an hlaidentical related or hlamatched unrelated stem cell donor being homozygous for the nonimmunogenic allele of the same minor h antigen encoding gene in the case of a putative hlamatched unrelated donor selection the disparity rate is the frequency of homozygous immunogenic aa and heterozygous aa individuals multiplied by the frequency of homozygous nonimmunogenic individuals aa aa  aa  aa sib transplantation disparity rates were estimated by 316aa2  12aaaa for both related and unrelated situations the rates were multiplied by the phenotype frequency of the relevant hla restriction molecule to investigate the level of disparity within each population twotailed wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed
 
spatial frequency distribution maps for each of the immunogenic minor h antigen phenotype frequencies were constructed for the white population samples using the kriging procedure 38 with the surfer eight software golden software  for these analyses the geographical area between 2900028000 latitudelongitude and 7200049000 covering the european continent was split into a 1000  five hundred and fifty squares grid using the standard software settings cartesian coordinates of the participating institutes were obtained from the getty thesaurus of geographic names online

we recruited and phenotyped 6148 individuals male and female ages 14102 y from a cluster of four towns in the lanusei valley 20 during physical examination of each individual a blood sample was collected for dna extraction and anthropometric traits were recorded here we report analyses of hip circumference weight and the derived quantity bmi which is calculated from a combination of height and weight genotyping was carried out using the affymetrix 10k and 500k chips  using standard protocols summary assessments of genotype data quality are provided in the results section and in table s1
 
to follow up on snps rs9930506 and rs6602024 we genotyped and examined the association between these two snps and bmi hip circumference and body weight in the gennet study the study comprises 3467 individuals in total recruited between one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive and two thousand and four 1101 aa eight hundred and thirtynine ha and 1496 ea individuals were recruited at two field centers ea were recruited from tecumseh michigan and aa and ha were recruited from maywood illinois participants were recruited from families starting from a proband with high blood pressure dna was available for 3205 individuals 968 aa eight hundred and twentyfour ha and one thousand four hundred and seventyone ea snp genotyping was performed using the 5nucleasebased assay taqman abi  analyzed on an abi prism seven thousand nine hundred real time pcr system within each ethnic group genotype completeness rates exceed 98 and there was no evidence for deviation from hardyweinberg equilibrium p  005
 
to ensure adequate control of type i error rates we applied an inverse normal transformation to each trait prior to analysis 20 the inverse normal transformation reduces the impact of outliers and deviations from normality on statistical analysis the transformation involves ranking all available phenotypes transforming these ranks into quantiles and finally converting the resulting quantiles into normal deviates we included sex age and age2 as covariates in all analysis height was significantly associated with weight and hip circumference and was included as an additional covariate in analysis of those traits we fitted a simple regression model to each trait and used a variance component approach to account for correlation between different observed phenotypes within each family for individuals who had genotype data available we coded genotypes as 0 1 and two depending on the number of copies of the allele being tested for individuals with missing genotype data we used the landergreen algorithm to estimate an expected genotype score between zero and 2 for each individual 24 briefly to estimate each genotype score we first calculate the likelihood of the observed genotype data then we instantiate each missing genotype to a specific value and update the pedigree likelihood the ratio of the two likelihoods gives a posterior probability that the instantiated genotype is true conditional on all available data due to computational constraints we divided large pedigrees into subunits with bitcomplexity of nineteen or less typically 2025 individuals before estimating missing genotypes
 
our analytical approach considers all observed or estimated genotypes rather than focusing on alleles transmitted from heterozygous parents and thus is not immune to effects of population stratification in homogenous populations this type of analysis is expected to be more powerful 5152 to adjust for the effects of population structure and cryptic relatedness among sampled individuals we used the genomic control method to adjust our test statistics for each trait separately 29 fdrs were calculated with rs padjust procedure using the method of benjamini and hochberg 30 since the initial analysis often identified clusters of nearby snps that all showed similar levels of association we also carried out a sequential stepwise analysis in this analysis we selected the best snp for each trait and then conditioned on it to successively select the next best snp this sequential analysis can help identify regions with multiple independent association signals the stepwise analysis was repeated for five rounds
 
we selected seventyfour candidate genes previously tested for association with obesity in humans 53 for each gene we first evaluated the ability of the affymetrix snps to tag common snps maf  005 within  five kb of the gene r two  zero point five zero or r two  080 using the hapmap ceu database 54 we then evaluated evidence for association using all affymetrix snps within each gene as well as neighboring affymetrix snps that could be used to improve coverage r two  05 for each gene we report coverage statistics as well as the snp that showed strongest evidence for association

the three bac libraries 30 total coverage used in this study were hindiii 136kb average insert size ecori 163kb and mboi 167kb libraries 2425 with 142 76 and 78 coverage respectively the use of three bac libraries helped to ensure the maize genome was fully represented maize cultivar b73 was selected because of its widespread use in breeding and because it is one of the parents of a public highresolution genetic reference mapping population ibm 43
 
bac clones starting with a b are from the b73 hindiii library zmmbbb bac clones starting with a c are from the b73 ecori and mboi libraries known as chori201 clemson university genomics institutearizona genomics institute cugiagi name zmmbbc in the c library the first half 288 384well plates was from the ecor1 digest and the second half was from the mboi digest clones ending in sd1 are sequenced bacs downloaded from genbank  digested with hindiii in silico 44 if the sequences were longer than one hundred and fifty kb they were artificially fragmented into multiple overlapping clones ie sd1 sd2 etc and then digested with hindiii in silico for the agarose method 2945 all bac dnas were digested with the restriction enzyme hindiii run on highresolution 10 agarose gels stained with sybr green fmc bioproducts  and the image software 46 was used for interactive band calling
 
for the hicf method 273031 bac dnas were digested with type iis restriction enzyme eari in which the resulting ends were tagged with fluorescently labeled ddntps and taqi which is to reduce the fragment sizes of the eari digestion the first base in a twobase overhang from taqi is g therefore ddctp was not used in the endlabeling reaction because the majority of fragments would contain at least one taqi site thus we only used c t and a overhangs for end labeling by using the fluorescent dyes ddgtp blue ddatp green and ddttp yellow respectively red dye genescan500 rox applied biosystems  was employed as an internal size standard which was run in each capillary reaction products were resolved on abi3700 automated dna sequencers abi genescan version 371 software applied biosystems was used for band detection and extraction only fragments ranging in size from seventyfive to five hundred bp were used for hicf assembly because fpc can only input one set of band values for each clone we used the technique of ding et al 31 to convert the sizecolor pairs generated by hicf each band was multiplied by 20 and the fractional part discarded an offset was then added to each band as follows zero to blue 10000 to green and 20000 to yellow bands since we used fragments in the range 75500 bp the result of this conversion was bands occupying the ranges 150010000 1150020000 and 2150030000
 
fpc software 26 was used for fingerprint assembly to automatically build the agarose map two clones assemble together if they share at least n markers and have a sulston score of less than m using the following n m pairs 0 1e12 1 1e11 2 1e10 or 3 1e09 falsepositive overlaps generally result in a stack of clones within the contig whose bands do not align well with the underlying consensus band map these clones are called q questionable clones 47 the fpc dqer function reassembles all contigs that have 5 q clones using a more stringent cutoff such as 1e13 1e14 or 1e15 if the more stringent cutoff breaks the contig into multiple contigs the function tries to join the subcontigs by their end clones if this is not possible it creates new contigs from the subcontigs if it cannot reduce the number of qs by a 1e15 it leaves the contig alone generation of the maize fpc map was performed in stages including manual editing that utilized the agarose assembly of 4518 contigs and all genetic and overgo markers the addition of these markers allowed us to reduce the sulston score for contig merging singletons were added in to merge contigs when they overlapped with the ends of two contigs the total contig number decreased from initial build of 4518 to 2085 and the assembly was publicly released in february two thousand and four table s1
 
to automatically build the hicf map possible contaminated clones were screened for sameplate overlaps at 1e45 followed by removal of all remaining clones over one hundred and seventyfive bands the initial contigs were built at 1e70 at the tolerance of 4 then the dqer reassembled all contigs that had 15 q clones the endmerging function was run at 1e61 1e52 1e45 1e40 and 1e21 where the endmerging function checks the clones at the ends of contigs and if at least two pairs of clones overlap based on the given cutoff the contigs are merged singletons were placed at 1e43 to their best location before the final endmerge
 
the agarose map was edited to split contigs with falsepositive joins and to merge contigs that had overlapping end clones that were too small to be detected by fpc first manual end joining was performed if the end clones from two contigs had a sulston score of n and at least m shared markers where the valid n m pairs were 0 1e10 1 1e09 2 1e08 or 3 1e07 we also extensively used the hicf map marker information and maizerice synteny for contig merging a new marker type called hicf was created which was used to link each pair of clones that are bridged by an hicf clone that did not occur in the agarose map we know that the pair of clones lie close to each other within one hundred and fifty kb and probably overlap but it cannot be confirmed the agarose method produced an average of thirty bands for each maize clone band size range from one to twentythree kb while the hicf method generated an average of one hundred and seven bands for each clone size range seventyfive bp500 bp 27
 
the metric of a fpc contig is the consensus band cb unit if the length of a contig is n cb units then its approximate length in base pairs is n  4900 the 4900 was calculated as the average size restriction fragment as follows a total of twenty completely sequenced maize bacs that had corresponding fingerprints were downloaded from genbank the average size of all sequenced bacs was divided by the average number of fingerprinted bands which resulted in an average band size of 4900 bp since the number of bands was taken from the real fingerprint and not from the simulated fingerprint this average size took into account missing bands this estimation is similar to that in the rice physical map 45
 
as an essential component to establish an integrated map for the maize genome a saturated and evenly distributed genetic map was developed to anchor and fully orient physical contigs along the chromosome we built a dense genetic framework using the ibm mapping population 43 the inbred parents of ibm are highly polymorphic and the progeny experienced four rounds of intermating which makes ibm nearly four times expanded in size and 18fold higher in resolution than previous public standard populations 48 the order of loci on the ibm map has proven to match closely that developed by fingerprinting and bac assembly
 
the number of genetically mapped markers was increased by intercalating locations of additional markers into the ibm constructing neighbors maps table 1 ie by importing markers from maps of other mapping populations and interpolating for genetic coordinates 49 successive iterations of neighbors maps have incorporated new map data from other projects and have refined orders according to fpc results maps have been updated regularly in maizegdb 50
 
we used probe hybridization on bac filters primer amplification methods on 6d bac pools and overgo probe hybridizations to integrate genetically mapped markers with the related bac clones in the maize physical map since genetic markers can hybridize to multiple contigs because of paralogous sequences it was necessary to distinguish between marked contigs that could be genetically placed and all other copies to this end anchoring markers retained their original name and any unanchored copies were assigned a suffix a markers included rflps ssrs ests snps and indels filter hybridization has low throughput so we used only ninety rflp probes on filters 24 and carried out further integrating with two highthroughput methods
 
hybridization of overgos was conducted on four filters of a six  six grid with a total of 165888 bacs half from each of the hindiii and ecori libraries the 40bp overgo probes were designed from unigenes of the dupontmmpincyte genomics partnership and were screened with a maize repeat database to ensure that each probe was low copy the overgos were classified into five marker types where the prefix identifies the marker type 1 the prefix cl identifies clusters assembled from public est sequences 2 pco represents public sequences combined with dupont sequences unigene consensus deposited in genbank 3 dd signifies anonymous clusters assembled by dupont sequences are not available 4 si represents public singletons that did not cluster with dupont sequences and 5 sog markers are overgos from the paterson lab derived from probes that have been mapped in sorghum and other grasses except for the sog markers which were designed for sequence conservation all other overgos were designed for their diversity we employed a 2d twentyfour  twentyfour pool strategy for overgo hybridization and scored dual grid spots as positive clones 28
 
pcr methods were used to screen bacs with ssr or genomic sequence markers a 6d pool strategy 51 was used for library screening to construct two hundred and eightyeight pools from a fortyeight  fortyeight  fortyeight block for a total of 82944 bacs in two hundred and sixteen 384well plates from the hindiii library primers for selected sequences were applied to pools and the data were deconvoluted using criteria that assured disambiguation by multiple confirmation
 
we used the symap 37 to compute and view the syntenic blocks the algorithm first computed anchors from the alignment of the maize markers and bes sequences to the rice genomic sequence and then calculated chains of anchors using dynamic programming and merged chains into blocks the graphical results from a versatile cgihtml and java display allow users to observe synteny from different views including dotplot genome blocks chromosome blocks closeup chromosomes closeup contigs and table view the results can be interactively browsed at

a list of cnc blocks which represent the 5 most conserved portions of the human genome were downloaded from the most conserved track of the ucsc genome browser these were generated by constructing a phylogenetic twostate hidden markov model 45 from the 17way multiple alignment which includes the human thirtyfive point one genome release 314144 to generate the data in table 5 the coordinates of each tfbs set were intersected with the cnc blocks likewise the average number of randomly chosen promoter regions 1000 trials found within cncs was determined the probability of finding a greater fraction of cncs in randomly chosen promoter regions over tfbs sites was calculated using a twotailed binomial test
 
for the roc curves in figure 3 the sensitivity true positive rate and 1specificity false positive rate of tfbs prediction were calculated at each of eleven conservation thresholds the true positive rate was the fraction of bona fide tfbss with a consensus sequence percent identity above a given level the false positive rate was calculated as the average number of sites 1000 trials that fell above a conservation threshold consensus sequence percent identity in an equivalently sized set of random promoter sequences for example eightythree tfbss composed the p53 roc curve therefore sets of eightythree random promoter sites where each site was twenty bases in length were used to estimate the false positive rate roc aucs table 6 and standard errors were calculated directly from the graphs using the trapezoid rule as described by hanley and mcneil 46
 
positional sequence diversity for a tfbs which is related to the inverse of sequence identity was calculated as the percentage of human nucleotides nt at each position that had a nonconsensus mismatch or insertiondeletion event when compared to one of the four mammals figure 4 each tfbs of a given class ie tp53 and its alignment to a mammal ie mouse was pulled from the multiz multiple alignments to produce a set of paired sequence alignments for each re member of this pool we counted the number of times where the first position of the mammalian sequence in the alignment differed from the human nt due to either a a nonconsensus mismatch or b an insertiondeletion event this count was divided by the total number of tfbss in a group ie eightythree for all p53 res or twentyone for all nfb res to get the percentage of twoway alignments that differed at that position this value is taken as the sequence diversity at that first position this calculation was then performed for the remaining nts in the tfbs mismatches from human that did not alter the consensus motif did not increase the percent sequence diversity and were ignored

we assume that in a familybased association study n family members have been genotyped at m loci with a genomewide snpchip for each marker locus a familybased association test is constructed based on the offspring phenotype and the withinfamily information the withinfamily information is defined as the difference between the observed genetic marker score and the expected genetic marker score which is computed conditional upon both the parental genotypessufficient statistic 19 under the assumption of mendelian transmissions we denote the familybased association test for the ith marker locus by fbati such an fbat statistic can be the standard tdt an fbat for quantitativequalitative traits fbatgee for multivariate traits etc 46182021 similarly for the ith marker the betweenfamily information can be used to assess the evidence for association at a populationbased level by computing a vansteentype 11 screening statistic ti the screening statistic is computed based on the data for offspring phenotype and the parental genotypessufficient statistic the statistic ti can be a wald test for the genetic effect size that is estimated based on the conditional mean model 22 or the estimated power of the familybased test fbati 23 either of which is feasible however while the fbati statistic is robust against population stratification the screening statistic ti is susceptible to confounding for this reason the vansteentype testing strategies have restrictively used the betweenfamily information as weights for pvalues of the fbatstatistic but never as a component in the test statistic itself
 
in order to construct a familybased association test that incorporates both the within and the betweenfamily information the zstatistics that correspond to the pvalues of fbati and ti are computed the statistic z is the  quantile of standard normal distribution pfbati and pti are the pvalue of the fbatstatistics and one sided pvalue of the screening statistic where the direction of the one sided screening statistic is defined by the directionality of fbati based on the statistical independence of fbati and ti 11 under the nullhypothesis we can obtain an overall familybased association test statistic zi by combining both zstatistics in a weighted sum where the parameters wfbat and wt are standardized weights so that the overall familybased association test zi has a normal distribution with mean zero and variance 1 ie wfbat 2wt two  one point in the literature this approach of combining two test statistics is known as the liptakmethod 24 however the liptakmethod varies here from its standard application in that the two test statistics have to be combined so that confounding in the screening statistic ti cannot affect the validity of the overall familybased association test statistic zi in the context of a genomewide association study gwas we are able to achieve this goal by using rankbased pvalues for the screening statistic ti instead of their asymptotic pvalues
 
the screening statistics ti are sorted based on their evidence for association so that t m denotes the screening statistic with the least amount of evidence for association and t 1 the screening statistic with the largest amount of evidence for association the rankbased pvalue i  05m is then assigned to the ordered screening test statistics t i if there is a tie then the average of the ranks will be used for the computation of the rankbased pvalue for the ith marker since the nullhypothesis will be true for the vast majority of the snps in a gwas the rankbased pvalues provide an alternative way to assess the significance of the populationbased screening statistic ti the overall association test zi is then computed based on the zscore for the asymptotic pvalue of the fbatstatistic and the zscore for the rankedbased pvalue of the screening statistic ti in text s1 we show that the overall association test zi maintains the global significance level  under any situations including population admixture and stratification this can be understood intuitively as well the smallest rankbased pvalue is 05m using the bonferronicorrection to adjust for multiple testing the individual adjusted significance level is m which will always be smaller than the smallest rankbased pvalue 05m unless the prespecified global significance level  is great than 05 this implies that the overall familybased association test can never achieve genomewide significance just based on the rankbased pvalues alone the fbatstatistic has to contribute evidence for the association as well in order for the overall familybased association test to reach genomewide significance finally we have to address the specification of the weights wfbat and wt in the overall familybased association test statistic zi while any combination of weights wfbat and wt will provide a valid test statistic zi the most powerful overall statistic zi is approximately achieved when the ratio of the weights is equal to the ratio of the standardized effect sizes the expected effect size of the regression coefficient divided by its estimated standard deviation for quantitative traits in unascertained samples one can show that optimal power levels are achieved for equal weights ie wfbat  wt in general the equal weighting scheme seems to provide good power levels for any disease mode of inheritance and for different trait types eg binary traits timetoonset etc the theoretical derivation of optimal weighting schemes for such scenarios is ongoing research and will be published subsequently
 
furthermore it is important to note that instead of the liptakmethod fishers method for combining pvalues could have been used as well to construct an overall familybased association test which would have the same robustness properties as the overalltest based on the liptakmethod however simulation studies data not shown suggest that the highest power levels are consistently achieved with the liptak method we therefore omit the approach based on fishers method here

hiv1 set point was defined as the average of the remaining vl results after careful assessment of each individual data and elimination of vl outliers see text s1 for criteria used to identify and exclude outlier vl data of note our phenotype definition leads to the exclusion rapid progressors that never reach a stable vl plateau the disease progression phenotype was defined as 1 the drop of cd4 t cells below 350ul or 2 the initiation of cart but only if the last cd4 t cell count before cart start was 500ul this later criterion was made necessary by the different rationales behind treatment initiation between patients and over time a large part of patients starting cart with cd4 t cell counts approaching the 350ul threshold did so because their cd4 slope actually showed a significant decrease whereas most of patients who started treatment with normal or subnormal cd4 t cell counts had stable cd4 t cell profiles since progression has been represented in a number of different ways in genetic studies we used the known genetic determinants to confirm that our measure is the most accurate by comparing it to survival analyses that used cart start either as a censoring event ie all patients starting cart are considered nonprogressors or as a progression event ie all patients starting cart are considered progressors table s8

the quality control of the genotyping data included a check on the gender specification obtained from the phenotype database using the observed genotypes of snps on chromosome x and y subjects that were identified as male in the phenotype file but had a significant amount of heterozygous x genotypes   1 as well as subjects that was identified as female in the phenotype file but had a high frequency of homozygous x genotypes   80 and y genotype readings were excluded
 
to control for the possibility of spurious associations resulting from population stratification we used a modified eigenstrat approach this method derives the principal components of the correlations among gene variants and corrects for those correlations in the association tests in principle therefore the principal components in the analyses should reflect population ancestry having noticed however that some of the leading axes depend on other sources of correlation such as sets of variants near one another that show extended association ld we inspected the snp loadings and followed a series of pruning procedures to ensure that eigenstrat axes reflected only effects that applied equally across the whole genome text s1
 
the core association analyses on hiv1 setpoint focused on singlemarker genotypetrend tests of the quality controlpassed snps using linear regression and including age gender and the significant eigenstrat axes values as covariates associations with progression were tested using a cox proportional hazards model we assessed significance with a bonferroni correction taking into account one million tests pvalue cutoff  5e08
 
to search for additional snps effects in the mhc region we used a forward selection algorithm to investigate all mhc snps with p1e04 n  331 the top two associated variants and the standard covariates were fixed in a linear regression model while new snps were added and selected into the model one at a time in the forward selection process a newly selected snp is expected to explain a certain proportion of the set point variation independently of all variables already in the model to control for multiple testing a permutation procedure was used to assess the empirical significance cutoff value in the permutation the ld patterns among snps were retained while the associations between snps and set point were permuted one thousand permutation runs were performed and the 5th percentile of the empirical distributions of the partial rsquares and the pvalues of the 1st 2nd 3rd etc selected snps were recorded and compared to the observed sample statistics the permutation pvalue was defined as the probability that the statistics observed in the permutation was more extreme than the statistics observed in the real sample the forward selection algorithm is expected to be conservative to verify this a largescale statistical simulation was performed considering different effect sizes various ld patterns among snps and different sample sizes text s1 the simulation results confirmed that the forward selection algorithm with permutation procedure is conservative
 
we performed a twoway interaction test between each qcpassed snp and the top associated variants for each genomewide significant polymorphism the screening procedure involved the calculation of the pvalue associated with each of the 1 million multivariate linear models incorporating the two polymorphisms the pvalue associated with the interaction term for this model was retained and then the top pvalues for all 1 million tests considered this approach followed recommendations that the search space for interactions can be appropriately reduced and therefore the power can be improved by focusing the search on pairs of polymorphisms including at least one that is known to be significant 39
 
the snps that were represented in all genotyping chips were mapped to their closest gene if 500 kb away and used in the gsea analysis if minor allele frequency was 005 hardyweinberg equilibrium test pvalue was 0001 and at least 90 individuals were successfully genotyped among the six hundred and thirtynine canonical pathway gene sets that are represented in the molecular signatures database msigdb  we tested the two hundred and ninetyeight gene sets that had at least twenty and at most two hundred genes represented in the study text s1
 
a permutation procedure was developed to test whether genetic variants with known functional role were more likely to have a lower pvalues distribution than supposedly neutral variants text s1 we compared the overall pvalue distribution of 12535 putatively functional polymorphisms including stopgained stoplost frameshift coding nonsynonymous coding and essential splicing site genetic variants with the global distribution of pvalues of all genotyped snps with 10000 permutations we also ran the same analysis for the mhc region only 318 functional variants and for the rest of the genome 12217 functional variants

supervised analysis to find genes associated with case versus control or low frataxin expression versus high expression was performed using significance analysis of microarrays sam after pooling the raw data 29 the twoclass unpaired sam algorithm was used and the false discovery rate was set to less than or equal to 1 for all analyses gene set analysis gsa 30 was also performed for these comparisons to test the association of gene sets instead of individual genes the database of gene sets used for gsa was obtained from the molecular signatures database msigdb 30 gene sets demonstrating a pvalue less than zero point zero one were considered significant
 
biologically relevant themes in the lists of significant genes from sam were analyzed with gene ontology tools gominer and david database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery 6768 go terms with p005 for upregulated downregulated andor combined direction of change were selected for analysis both tools group genes according to the go categories of biological process cellular component and molecular function based on ranking by a hypergeometric test pvalue these data were also uploaded into ingenuity pathway analysis ipa software v 551 ingenuity systems redwood city ca a program that categorizes genes into biological functions but also enables visualization of biologically relevant networks and canonical pathways canonical implies established go to wwwingenuitycom for specifics regarding the application unsupervised clustering and heatmap generation were carried out with cluster and treeview programs 69
 
the levels of dna damage were analyzed by mannwhitney u test or spearmans rank correlation because the data is not normally distributed or homoskedastic
 
in order to test association between gene expression and age we used sam for the two dna damage variables we used a students ttest to detect association with age all these analyses were performed in the controls and age was dichotomized by comparison to the median age of the controls
 
a univariate linear model was constructed to test the association of each gene in the genotoxic gene set list genes found in 25 of gene lists from significant gene sets to patient frataxin levels determined by realtime pcr correlations of frataxin mrna levels to all available clinical data for each child were also performed by univariate linear modeling
 
in extracting gene expression patterns epig 42 uses a filtering process where all profiles initially are considered as pattern candidates briefly using all pairwise correlations any candidate profile whose local cluster size is less than a predefined size mt or its correlation with another profile is higher rt but has a lower local cluster size m is removed from pattern construction consideration among the remaining profiles epig then creates representative profiles for the corresponding local clusters and removes those profiles with a signaltonoise ratio or magnitude less than given thresholds after this filtering processing the remaining profiles consist of the extracted patterns which are used to be the representatives to each of the local clusters subsequently epig categorizes each significant gene to a pattern for which it has the highest correlation with the gene profile a gene not assigned to any extracted pattern is considered an orphan if its highest correlation rvalue is lower than the given threshold r
 
the frataxin probe on the agilent chip was observed to lack sensitivity for both the individual lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected people data not shown and the whole blood from frda patients we therefore decided to obtain relative gene expression levels of frataxin by taqman realtime pcr 70 the sequence information of the probe used for taqman is the proprietary information of pe applied biosystems but we know it is seventyfive nucleotides that span across the exon one and exon two boundary on the other hand the probe on the microarray chip is mostly from the 3 utr of frataxin
 
one microgram of total rna from twentyseven patients and ten controls was used for reverse transcription with taqman reverse transcription reagents pe applied biosystems to determine relative frataxin mrna levels realtime pcr was carried out using the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system primer and probe sets for frataxin and glucuronidasebeta were purchased as predeveloped assays from pe applied biosystems relative quantification was obtained using the threshold cycle method after verification of primer performance following the manufacturers guidelines the levels of frataxin obtained are relative to the average c t from ten controls

frozen tissue samples of the cerebellum crblm frontal cortex fctx caudal pons pons and temporal cortex tctx were obtained from one hundred and fifty neurologically normal caucasian subjects text s1 100200mg aliquots of frozen tissue were subdissected from each tissue from all one hundred and fifty subjects resulting in six hundred tissue samples and used for methylation assay and expression assays genotyping was performed using infinium humanhap550 beadchips illumina to assay genotypes for five hundred and sixtyone thousand four hundred and sixtysix snps from the cerebellum tissue samples cpg methylation status was determined using humanmethylation27 beadchips illumina which measure methylation at 27578 cpg dinucleotides at 14495 genes profiling of 22184 mrna transcripts was performed using humanref8 expression beadchips illumina as previously described 27
 
the threshold call rate for inclusion of the subject in analysis was 95 all one hundred and fifty subjects had a call rate greater than 95 and were included in the subsequent analyses average call rate  9986 range 97729995 based on the missing procedure within the plink v104 software toolset 17
 
the gender of the subjects reported by the brain banks was compared against their genotypic gender using plinks checksex algorithm which determines a samples genotypic gender based on heterozygosity across the x chromosome a gender discrepancy was detected for one subject and excluded from further analysis
 
to confirm the ethnicity of the samples identitybystate ibs clustering and multidimensional scaling analyses were performed within plink using the genotypes from the brain samples that had been merged with data from the four hapmap 28 populations n  thirtytwo caucasian ceu twelve han chinese sixteen japanese and twentyfour yoruban nontrio samples previously genotyped by illumina and assayed on the infinium humanhap500 version genotyping chips two samples were outliers based on population and excluded from further analysis figure s1
 
genotype data of the samples were compared for cryptic relatedness using the identitybydescent ibd procedure within plink no samples were found to be from related individuals
 
mach software version 1016 16 and hapmap ceu phase data release 22 were used to impute genotypes for 25 million snps imputed snps were excluded if the linkage disequilibrium r2 values between imputed and known genotypes was less than 03 and if their posterior probability averages were less than zero point eight for the most likely imputed genotype for each of the four tissue regions snps were also excluded if a call rate was less than 95 b hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe pvalue was less than 0001 and c the snp had less than three minor homozygotes present exact numbers of snps used per brain tissue and assay type are shown in table one point
 
raw intensity values for each probe were transformed using the rank invariant normalization method 2931 and then log2 transformed for mrna analysis four samples were excluded from further analysis as they were outliers based on overall probe detection rate andor mean expression level one crblm one fctx and two pons
 
the threshold call rate for inclusion of samples in the analysis was 95 based on this metric nine crblm two fctx six pons and eight tctx samples were excluded from further analysis the remaining brain samples had an average detection rate of 9984 range 950 to 9998
 
the gender of the samples reported by the brain banks were compared against their assayed gender based on values of methylation from cpg sites on the x chromosome four samples with gender discrepancies were detected and were removed from subsequent analysis two crblm one pons and one tctx the resulting hcl sample tree based on all chromosome x probes after removal of these four individuals is shown in figure s3
 
performing a hierarchical clustering hcl 9 of the sample profiles using the tm4 mev version 4101 tool 32 with euclidian distances and average linkage clustering resulted in the samples separating fairly well by brain tissue region where in mrna separation of samples into four clusters matching brain tissue region was clear the frontal and temporal cortices could not be separated in within cpg data for clustering all detected data was used for mrna only detected data for autosomal probes was used in clustering of the cpg data otherwise subclusters based on gender appeared the hcl samples trees were saved a newick tree files and plotted again using the hypertree tool 
 
traits were excluded from analysis if they were detected in less than 95 of samples for each tissue region for each tissue region and trait type cpg and mrna the 95 threshold was determined using total number of analyzable samples for this pairing of region and trait a probe is considered detected for a sample if the reported illumina detection pvalue was less than or equal to 001 numbers of analyzable samples per trait or assay type and region are available in table one overlap of detected probes among brain tissues is shown as venn diagram in figure s2
 
prior to quantitative trait loci analysis each trait was adjusted using the available biological and methodological covariates in an attempt to remove the influence of these potentially confounding affects in r each trait was regressed using the following modelwhere y is the trait profile log2 normalized mrna expression intensities and raw values of cpg dna methylation and x1  xn represent the biological covariates age and gender and the methodological covariates post mortem interval pmi which brain bank the samples was from and which preparationhybridization batch the sample was processed in within this model gender tissue bank and batch where treated as categorical covariates after fitting each trait to the model the residuals from the model are kept and represent the trait in following analyses thus variance attributable to gender age postmortem interval tissue source and hybridization batch are removed prior to qtl analysis these covariate data are available in table s1 histograms showing the proportion of traits that are potentially impacted by these covariates are shown in figure s4 cpg and figure s5 mrna
 
for each of the four brain regions a regression analysis was performed on the residuals described in the preceding section for a mrna expression and b the methylation values generated for cpg sites the trait residuals were then used as the quantitative phenotype for that probe in genomewide association analysis looking for quantitative trait loci these analyses were performed using the assoc function within plink which correlates allele dosage with change in the trait each of the four tissue regions was analyzed separately and independent genomewide association analyses were performed looking for a expression quantitative trait loci eqtls for mrna and b methylation quantitative trait loci methqtls for cpg sites the plink toolset quantitative trait association analysis fits data to the following modelwhere y is the quantitative trait and add represent genotypes encoded as allele dosage see plink quantitative trait association and linear and logistic models documentation for more information
 
to correct for the large number of snps tested per trait a genomewide empirical pvalue was computed for the asymptotic pvalue for each snp by using 1000 permutations of swapping sample labels of the traits using the maxt permutation functionality provided within plink a permutation based method using label swapping of the traits is an appropriate method of test correction 18 for these analysis as it is not dependent on these quantitative traits having a normal distribution and also allows the linkage disequilibrium of the genomic regions being tested against the traits to be maintained
 
to correct for the number of traits being tested per tissue region a false discovery rate fdr threshold was determined based on the empirical pvalues using the fwer2fdr function of the multtest package in r version 261 empirical pvalues were allowed to exceed this threshold if their linkage disequilibrium r2 was greater than or equal to zero point seven with a snp with empirical values within the fdr threshold
 
sequence variants within the sequence of the probe used to assay individual traits may cause differential hybridization and inaccurate expression and possible methylation measurements to exclude this confound the sequences of probes with significant correlation to a trait were examined for the presence of polymorphisms using ceu hapmap data and if present that qtl was removed from the result set
 
within each tissue we selected every pairing of cpg methylation sites and mrna transcripts where the cpg methylation site was within 1mb of the mrna tss and both the cpg methylation site or mrna transcript had a significant cis qtl these cpgmrna pairs were then expanded into triplets of snp and cpgmrna pair where the snp was significantly correlated in cis with either the cpg methylation site or mrna transcript of the cpgmrna pair

the core was removed from cs1006 derivative met2del by introducing a portion of the tyr1 gene pcr fragment defined by primers 5tgaaggaaagaggacagcatatccacttgataaacaaagtatttacccaaggactgcgacatcattaccgtgcattcccttcatg and 5gccacttgttcgaatagattcttagtgatatattaactttcacattttct
 
loss of core was identified by conversion of strain to g418 sensitive and 5foa resistant at the end of this stage two sets of strains were created cs1004 derivative with met6 del and with tyr1 allele of 1700 bp and cs1006 derivative with tyr1 allele 3001359 bp
 
diploid cells were made from derivatives of the above strains cs one thousand and sixtyone and cs one thousand and sixtyfour see table 1 by introducing plasmid yepho encoding ho endonuclease under its native promoter to the haploid strains nonmating cells were identified as potential diploids and confirmed by ability to sporulate each a diploid was then transformed with a pgalhot plasmid were ho is inducible by galactose 56 cells were grown six hr on galactose containing media to induce mating type switching mataa and  cells were identified by mating test the aa and  strains were isolated from each set of haploid strains met 6del 5 tyr1 allele and met 2del 3 tyr1 allele the mataa and a cells served as diploid 1and two as shown in figure one point
 
wt tetraploid cells were obtained by crossing several diploid isolates with opposite mating strains and complementing met mutations cells were selected on media lacking methionine and confirmed to be nonmating they also exhibited spontaneous and uv induced tyr recombination
 
the following oligonucleotides were used to create g418r and hygromicinr cassettes that could be targeted to mcd1 open reading frame using plasmids pfa6 and pag32 respectively 5tccataacaaaaaaggactggtcaaagaaaagacaactcaattgcacaattactttacaagaaacacgacacgtacgctgcaggtcgacggatcccc and 5ttaaagtctttgatctatatatgcatcagcttattgggtccaccaagaaatcccctcggcgtaactaggttatcgatgaattcgagctcgttttcgg
 
the mcd1 heterozygote diploid was created by transforming diploid one and two cells with the targeted g418r and hygromicinr cassettes respectively independent mcd1 heterozygote isolates derived from diploids one and two were crossed to create mcd1 duplexes two wt alleles with one g418r and one hygromicinr replacement alleles see figure 1 duplexes were transformed with a ura3 cassette that was targeted to an internal 23 aa in frame portion of the open reading frame by amplifying ura3 gene from prs306 using primers 5tggttacagaaaatcctcaacgtcttactgttttaagacttgccaccaataagggtccattagcacaaatacagagcagattgtactgagagtgcacc and 5taagcattgataaacctttcaaatagtgcaggtttggcgtctattttaatatttccgaatgcttctgtttgcgcatctgtgcggtatttcacaccgc
 
ura transformants were confirmed to be mcd1 simplex if they maintained g418r hygromicinr were nonmating and tyr recombinants could be induced in addition genomic dna was purified from the putative simplex and mcd1 locus was pcr using the flanking primers 5gtcgagaaaatcgcgtctttc and 5agaaaatttcggcttcaccg
 
since the mcd1 orf size is almost identical to the g418r cassette another set of pcr derived constructs was developed using a primer within the cassette 5cgtacgctgcaggtcgac and a primer outside the orf 5agaaaatttcggcttcaccg this analysis revealed two pcr products corresponding to g418r and hygromicinr cassettes immediately after pcr verification of the simplex genotype patches were stored at 70c at the beginning of each experiment cells were streaked from the frozen stock for single colonies which were tested for the presence of the simplex markers
 
smc3 simplex strains were created similarly using primers 5catctttaaacagtttcaccatttttttacaagacgacctgctggagtaacggtaatagttcacgtctgcacgtacgctgcaggtcgacggatcccc and 5cagtacctctgggaactaatctttcaaaaacagcttcaaagttttcagaaaccttttggaaagtagaatcaatcgatgaattcgagctcgttttcga to create g418 and hygromycin resistant cassettes directed to the orf as well as primers 5atgtatatcaaaagggtgataattaagggttttaaaacctacaggaacgaaaccattattgataatttctcagagcagattgtactgagagtgcacc and 5accgcgttaaccttttgttgttttaacttaacaattagatcttgaattgagtctttagattcatccagctccgcatctgtgcggtatttcacaccgc to amplify prs306 to create a ura3 cassette targeted to the orf the simplex was verified by primers flanking the locus 5 catcgaagtgtacacctgtcacat and 5 gaaaagtaatcttttttgtacgtcg
 
rad50 simplexes were made in a manner similarly to above oligonucleotides 5tttcacggctttgccttgt and 5tcaaaggtgcttacgtgcttg were used to amplify the flanking region around the rad50 locus in a null strain from the saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion library g418 cassette replaced orf both diploids one and two were transfected with a g418 cassette and after obtaining heterozygote diploid isolated the g418 cassette of one of the diploids was switched to hygromicin resistance the two heterozygote diploids were crossed and the tetraploid duplex was transformed with a ura3 cassette targeted to an internal portion of the orf by amplifying the ura3 gene from prs306 using the following primers 5tctattcagggcatacggtcttttgactccaatgatagggaaactattgaatttggcaagcctctgacttcagagcagattgtactgagagtgcacc and 5tatcgacccactcaatttgtgatttttgcctatcatctctcttgactttgaagaagtgatcagtaaatgccgcgcatctgtgcggtatttcacaccgc simplex strains were selected as described above
 
construction of the rad51 simplex was done by sequential transfection of diploid1 with g418 and ura3 cassettes thereby replacing two copies of the gene diploid two was transfected with a hygromicin cassette targeted into the orf of the gene g418 and hygromicin cassettes were made based on strains from a saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion library using primers 5 ttgagcattccctgagcatt and 5tcccctaaaaggataaagccg ura3 cassette was created by amplifying prs306 using primers 5catatatcagagtcacagcttcagtacgggaacggttcgttgatgtccactgtaccagcagacctttcaccagagcagattgtactgagagtgcacc and 5ggtcaccaacaccatcttcatagatcgcgaacacacattcagcctctggtaagcaaggtgagtcaacaaccgcatctgtgcggtatttcacaccgc the rad51 simplex strain was created by crossing the transformed diploids one and two point
 
cs1061 and cs1064 a and  haploids that contain the same types of tyr1 truncation alleles described above crossed to yield wt diploid same haploid strains were transformed with an age1 cut pvg257 31 to yield the mcd11 strain the mcd11 cells were verified by sequencing and later crossed to the opposite mating counterpart to create a diploid mcd11 strain

the agesreykjavik study includes a sample of 5764 survivors from the reykjavik study of 30795 men and women born between one thousand nine hundred and seven and one thousand nine hundred and thirtyfive point the aric study includes 15792 men and women aged fortyfive to sixtyfour who were enrolled in a prospective followup study from four us communities from one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven to one thousand nine hundred and eightynine point the chs includes 5201 mostly caucasian participants aged sixtyfive years or older that were randomly sampled from medicare lists in four us communities from one thousand nine hundred and eightynine to one thousand nine hundred and ninety point the fhs recruited 5209 participants aged twentyeight to sixtytwo from framingham massachusetts beginning in one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight point beginning in 1971 5124 offspring of the original cohort members and the offsprings spouses were also recruited as part of the offspring cohort fhs subjects in this study are from the offspring cohort who attended the second examination in 19711973 finally the rs recruited 7983 subjects aged fiftyfive years or older from ommoord a suburb of rotterdam between one thousand nine hundred and ninety and one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree point only subjects selfreporting european ancestry from each cohort are included as a part of this study
 
after conducting the metaanalysis within the charge study genotype data on an additional nine hundred and fortyeight study participants of european ancestry became available within aric these individuals were independent from the ones included in the discovery sample they were not part of the discovery had no firstdegree relationship with any individual in the discovery sample and would not have been classified as an outlier based on allele sharing measures generated during quality control procedures of the discovery sample
 
the kora study is a series of independent populationbased epidemiological surveys of participants living in the region of augsburg southern germany 49 all survey participants were residents of german nationality identified through the registration office and were examined in 199495 kora s3 and 19992001 kora s4 in 200405 3006 subjects participated in a 10year followup examination of s3 kora f3 and in 200608 3080 subjects participated in a 7year followup examination of s4 kora f4 individuals for genotyping in kora f3 and kora f4 were randomly selected the age range of the participants was twentyfive to seventyfour years at recruitment
 
the study of health in pomerania ship is a crosssectional survey in west pomerania the northeast area of germany 50 a sample from the population aged twenty to seventynine years was drawn from population registries only individuals with german citizenship and main residency in the study area were included of 7008 subjects sampled 4310 participants comprised the final ship population
 
details of genotyping methods exclusion criteria and imputation methods for the discovery and replication samples can be found in table s1 briefly snps were genotyped within each cohort from 20062008 using commercially available wholegenome platforms and each cohort imputed genotypes to a common set of about two point five million autosomal snps imputation was carried out using mach version 1091516 agesreykjavik aric fhs kora and rs accessed from  bimbam version zero point nine nine 51 software chs or imputev050 52 ship for the imputation genotype data from the individual studies was combined with genotype data from hapmap ceu samples to probabilistically infer the allelic dosage for each snp a fractional value from zero point zero to 20 based on the hapmap ceu haplotype structure imputation quality scores were calculated for each snp as the ratio of observed dosagevariance to the expected binomial variance
 
the primary outcomes for this study were serum concentrations of magnesium potassium and sodium we additionally evaluated the lead snps identified in association with other clinicallyrelevant phenotypes including hypomagnesemia defined as serum magnesium 07 mmoll charge blood pressure charge egfr charge fasting glucose magic and bmd gefos serum magnesium discovery aric fhs rs replication aric kora f3 kora f4 ship sodium aric fhs rs and potassium aric chs fhs rs concentrations were measured using standard protocols from fasting blood where possible serum magnesium levels were determined using the method described by gindler and heth with metallochromic dye calmigate 11hydroxy4methyl2phenylazo2napthol4sulfonic acid in the aric study by metpath in fhs with a merck diagnostica kit method xylidyl blue on an elan autoanalyzer merk in rs with a xylidylblue kit on a modular analyzer roche in the kora study or using a commercial colorimetric test roche diagnostics mannheim germany with a hitachi seven hundred and seventeen autoanalyzer in the ship study sodium and potassium levels were measured using standard ion electrode devices in all cohorts
 
detailed descriptions of blood pressure and egfr traits are given in other references 24 25 and are described in brief here serum creatinine used to calculate egfr was measured using a modified kinetic jaffe method aric chs fhs rs or an enzymatic method agesreykjavik creatinine values were calibrated to age and sexadjusted mean values from a nationally representative study as described previously 53 and egfr mlmin173 m2 was calculated using the 4variable mdrd study formula 54 due to the skewed distribution a natural log transformation was applied before the association analyses repeated resting sbp and dbp measures were recorded by trained staff in all studies and the average of multiple readings was used height and weight were measured by trained study personnel in all studies and were used to calculate bmi kgm2 use of blood pressure medications was defined differently in the different cohorts but for all cohorts hypertension medication use was determined at the time of serum electrolyte determination and included all classes of antihypertension medications commonly prescribed at the time including betablockers diuretics aceinhibitors angiotensin type2 antagonists calciumchannel blockers as well as combination therapies
 
snps were modeled as allelic dosages in all analyses genomewide analyses of electrolyte concentrations magnesium potassium and sodium were conducted within the r package probabel  55 for aric chs and rs or using linear mixed effects regression models in the r kinship package to account for pedigree structure in fhs snpelectrolyte associations were adjusted for age sex and study center where applicable for analyses of sodium and potassium concentrations subjects using any hypertension medications at the time of electrolyte assessment were excluded to avoid a possible influence of the medications on serum concentrations of sodium and potassium genomic control correction based on median chisquare was used within each study to adjust for inflation of the test statistics prior to metaanalysis as well as applied to the combined results after the metaanalysis inversevariance weighted fixedeffects metaanalyses were carried out by two independent analysts using the software metal wwwsphumicheducsgabecasismetal for the 25 million snps across aric fhs rs and chs potassium only after metaanalysis results were filtered to remove snps with low minor allele frequency 001 statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using cochranes 2 test qtest pvalues 5108 were used to indicate genomewide significant results the size of the associated regions was determined using the positions of the most upstream and downstream regional snps with pvalues5105 manhattan and qq plots were generated for the metaanalyzed data using the r statistical software package  plots of the log10pvalues by genomic position for associations within regions of statistical significance were generated using the snap program  in snap the hapmap ceu population was used as the reference group to map ld patterns in the familybased fhs heritability of serum magnesium sodium and potassium was estimated using age and sexadjusted residuals in a variance components model that estimated additive genetic heritability and a random environmental component using solar v14 56
 
the six lead snps with evidence of genomewide significant association in discovery plus an additional three snps with suggestive evidence of association were evaluated for independent replication in the replication studies snpmagnesium associations were determined in linear regression models as described for the discovery cohorts inversevariance weighted fixed effects metaanalysis was used to determine associations across the replication samples and to calculate the overall combined associations for the discovery and replication cohorts
 
for the lead snps we calculated the percent of magnesium variance attributable to the snp as the difference in the adjusted r2 value for a model containing the snp age sex and study center where applicable to a model containing only age sex and study center expressed as a percent assuming independent effects of the snps we added the individual variance across the snps to calculate the total variance explained by the set of snps the independence assumption was verified by simultaneous inclusion of all snps into a regression model we also evaluated the five lead snps from charge with evidence for replication in logistic models of hypomagnesemia in aric and rs only because of small numbers of subjects with hypomagnesemia in fhs or linear models of egfr mlmin173 m2 adjusted for age sex and study center results for blood pressure mm hg traits in association with the snps were adjusted for age age squared sex and bmi to be consistent with the published data from a gwas of blood pressure in the charge consortium and blood pressure among treated and untreated individuals was modeled as described in this publication 24 57 inversevariance weighted fixed effects metaanalysis was used to determine summary effect estimates for these additional traits
 
we further evaluated these snps in association with fasting glucose and bmd as an in silico lookup in large available datasets from two consortia fasting glucose associations were available from up to 46180 subjects of european descent from the magic consortium 15 and bmd associations femoral neck and lumbar spine in 19195 subjects of northern european descent from the gefos consortium 16
 
to examine the association between serum magnesium levels and common variation in previously identified magnesium transporter proteins from model systems 7 2834 or in genes with rare variants responsible for monogenic disorders of magnesium metabolism we examined associations with snps within sixty kb of the genes 58 and reported the association and annotation for the lead snp within each gene region

this study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki and obtained informed consent from participants and approval from the appropriate institutional review boards
 
all subjects included in these metaanalyses were current or former smokers of european ancestry results from thirtyfour datasets which include a total of 38617 unrelated subjects who were assessed for cigarettesperday contributed to the metaanalyses eight of the datasets were drawn from familybased studies and contributed only a subset of unrelated individuals to these analyses table one gives sample sizes and demographics of each participating study sample text s7describes additional details for each dataset including ascertainment criteria and genotyping methods and documents that four datasets are also members of other consortia all datasets contributed to the analyses of smoking a subset of these thirtyfour datasets also had information on lung cancer cases and lungcancerfree smoker controls 6 datasets n  13614 smokers andor copd cases and copdfree smoker controls 4 datasets n  6182 smokers the data for these traits are described in table two and table three respectively
 
the traits examined were smoking quantity lung cancer and copd two smoking traits were derived from measurements of cigarettes smoked per day cpd a 4level categorical trait cpd10 10cpd20 20cpd30 and cpd30 and a dichotomous trait contrasting subjects from the lowest smoking category cpd10 lightsmoking controls to those in the two highest categories combined cpd20 heavy smoking cases the dichotomous trait of heavy versus light smoking was our primary trait for analysis for one study nagfinland which used different boundaries to record cpd as detailed in the supplemental material the distribution of cpd was examined to harmonize the phenotypes and select alternative boundaries the numbers of subjects in each smoking category total and by study are given in table one point lung cancer and copd were analyzed as dichotomous traits copd cases were defined to have copd as determined by postbronchodilator spirometry as gold stage ii or worse n  1719 or selfreported copd emphysema or chronic bronchitis
 
in europeanancestry populations each of the four loci of interest can be represented by various highly correlated snps snps having high r2 with each other for each locus we chose one target snp for analysis rs16969968 locus 1 rs578776 locus 2 rs588765 locus 3 and rs12914008 locus 4 the pairwise correlations between any two of these loci are r205 table s1 in samples for which a given target snp was not available we chose a highly correlated proxy snp based on r2 computed with haploview 26 using downloaded hapmap ceu genotype data release twentythree 27 table s2 lists the proxy snps used and their r2 with the corresponding target snps figure s1 displays the snps for each of the four loci in relation to the chrna5chrna3chrnb4 cluster
 
to ensure uniform analyses sas sas institute cary nc and r 28 scripts for genetic association analyses were developed centrally and then distributed the scripts were executed by each participating site and the results returned to the coordinating group
 
in each dataset associations between the loci and the traits were evaluated using logistic regression our primary analysis model coded genotypes additively as the number of copies of the minor allele according to the hapmap ceu reference population this allele is referred to as the coded allele c and the major allele is referred to as the reference allele r to confirm the appropriateness of the additive model for each locus a two degree of freedom model including the additive term and a heterozygote deviation term was evaluated the analyses of the 4level cpd trait used generalized logistic regression to obtain separate effect estimates beta coefficients for each category with respect to the lowest smoking category as the referent all these association analyses included sex and age as covariates in addition lung cancer and copd analyses included categorical cigarettesperday as an unordered covariate
 
association results from each dataset including the beta coefficient and standard error were provided to the coordinating team metaanalysis was carried out using plink 29 to obtain overall summary odds ratios ors and statistics the r package rmeta 30 was used to verify results and create plots there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity across datasets for these analyses minimum heterogeneity p  zero point two one for dichotomous cpd zero point zero seven for lung cancer zero point two four for copd for categorical cpd a nominally significant p was seen only for category three and locus one p  0007 because of varying study designs ascertainment strategies and representative snps we nevertheless report results from random effects metaanalyses
 
as noted earlier locus one representing rs16969968 is a highly replicated association finding and furthermore rs16969968 has been shown to have functional effects on the resulting alpha5containing receptor 19 therefore an important question is whether the remaining loci demonstrate additional independent effects on disease risk although loci 2 three and four are not highly correlated with rs16969968 d is high a high d can correspond to a low r2 if the alleles that tend to cooccur on the same haplotype have very different allele frequencies previous results in the cogend data suggest that there may be independent or synergistic effects on nicotine dependence between locus one and locus three 4 and haplotype analyses in the utah and lhs samples 7 and in the cogend and cpsiicpd samples 22 also indicate effects of haplotypes containing loci 1 two and three point
 
to test whether additional loci contribute to dichotomous smoking quantity over and above the effect of rs16969968 we included both locus one and each of the other loci in the logistic regression models adjusting for sex and age with and without a snpsnp interaction term for lung cancer and copd the models also included categorical cigarettesperday as an unordered covariate these results were then metaanalyzed as described above the snpsnp interaction term was never significant in the metaanalysis p03 so we report results from the joint models without interactions to allow comparison between singlesnp and joint results on comparable data for each locus pair we also repeated the univariate singlesnp metaanalyses on the subset of datasets that had genotypes available at both loci for dichotomous smoking quantity we also tabulated pairwise joint genotype by case status counts for locus one rs16969968 versus each of the other three loci across the contributing datasets that had both loci
 
across the four target loci multiple traits 4 the multiple models additive and additiveheterozygote deviation and the 2snp joint analyses 3 loci our study was designed to perform fewer than eighty tests a conservative bonferroni correction would result in an uncorrected pvalue threshold of 625104 corresponding to an experimentwide alpha of 005 the results tables report uncorrected pvalues which we compared to this threshold to determine statistical significance

a description of each study is provided in table one and text s1 lung cancer cases and controls for the gwas were drawn from the genetic epidemiological study of lung adenocarcinoma gelac in taiwan a total of five hundred and eightyfour neversmoking incident cases and five hundred and eightyfive neversmoking controls were included in the gwas the replication studies were drawn from seven studies including additional subjects from the gelac study 13 the chinese academy of medical sciences cancer hospital study camsch 16 the wuhan lung cancer study whlcs 17 the seoul national university study snu 18 the korea university medical center study kumc 19 the kyungpook national university hospital study knuh 20 and the shanghai womens health cohort study swhs 21 22 in addition data were pooled with previously published findings from the nanjing lung cancer study njlcs 23 and the genes and environment in lung cancer singapore study gels 24 table 1 all studies are casecontrol studies with the exception of the swhs which is a prospective cohort study the range of ages is similar in cases and controls across all studies table 1
 
all study subjects provided informed consent and each study was approved by its respective institutions irb
 
gwas genotyping of the gelac samples was performed in two separate phases in the pilot phase fiftyfour cases and fiftyfour controls were genotyped by genetech biotech co taiwan using the illumina humancnv370duo beadchip the cases were neversmoking females diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma at age 51 who had questionnaire data and dna that passed quality control criteria for scanning the controls were neversmoking females matched by age 2 years to cases
 
cluster definitions were determined using illumina beadstudio genotyping module v334 genotype calls were based on a quality score gene call value of zero point two five or higher four blind duplicate pairs were included and the concordance of snp genotype calls between each pair is greater than 99997 quality control metrics for data from the first phase are similar to those for data from the second phase detailed below
 
in the second phase of the gwas five hundred and fifty cases and five hundred and fortynine controls were genotyped with the illumina humanhap610 quad beadchip on contract at decode genetics iceland the cases were the first neversmoking female lung adenocarcinoma subjects to be enrolled in the study with questionnaire data and dna that passed quality control for scanning cluster definitions were determined using the illumina beadstudio genotyping module the median genotype call rate for samples was 9978 95 overall displayed call rates larger than 9949 the median call rate for variants is 9991 with 95 of variants with call rates above 9955 twentyone blind duplicate pairs displayed an average concordance greater than 9999
 
after quality control metrics were applied 457504 snps were used for the association analysis snps n  1705 were excluded if the call rate was below 90 ie a missing rate larger than 01 snps with a minor allele frequency below zero point zero five n  131558 snps with missing rate between zero point zero two and zero point one and nonrandom genotype failure with p002 n  1046 and significant deviation from fitness for hardyweinberg equilibrium p00001 in controls n  718 one thousand and sixtyfour unique samples from phase two were used in the association analysis after two exclusion steps the first set of exclusions was based on the quality control metrics described above and relatedness among individuals call rates less than 90 n  3 sex discrepancies based on the x chromosome heterozygosity n  7 contaminated samples with high heterozygosity scores n  4 first or second degree relatives identified using genomewide pairwise identical by descent ibd estimates n  9
 
we further excluded twelve individuals from phase 2 based on population substructure analysis in fact to detect differences in population substructure pairwise population concordance ppc test in plink  36 were performed with a threshold of 1020 on two data sets using all autosomal snps that had passed the quality control metrics described above the first data set consists of the one thousand one hundred and eightyfour unrelated individuals with high quality genotype data 108 from phase one and one thousand and seventysix from phase 2 the ppc test identified fifteen outliers who were distinct from the remaining one thousand one hundred and sixtynine 105 from phase one and one thousand and sixtyfour from phase 2 the eight selfdescribed aborigines 2 in phase one and six in phase 2 were among the outliers based on the ppc analysis the final genomewide association analysis was conducted using one thousand one hundred and sixtynine samples
 
to further assess the population homogeneity in our study sample we conducted additional analyses in our one thousand one hundred and eightyfour individuals with hapmap3 release two data 37 the results indicate that for the one thousand one hundred and eightyfour unrelated individuals with high quality genotype data fifteen outliers were detected thus yielding one thousand one hundred and sixtynine individuals with homogeneous genetic structure available for followup analyses we seeded the study population with genotype data from hapmap three as well as hapmap 2 this included eightyfive chd chinese in metropolitan denver colorado in addition to our one thousand one hundred and eightyfour individuals and the hapmap two 84 chb han chinese in beijing china and eightysix jpt japanese in tokyo japan a second analysis included our one thousand one hundred and eightyfour study individuals and a larger sample of hapmap3 release 2 namely the chb chd gih gujarati indians in houston texas jpt lwk luhya in webuye kenya mkk maasai in kinyawa kenya and tsi toscani in italia the results confirmed that fifteen outliers were detected whereas the one thousand one hundred and sixtyfour represented a homogeneous population
 
although the above ppc tests seem to suggest little population substructure in our one thousand one hundred and sixtynine samples we still used eigenstrat 38 to conduct gwas analysis to correct possible population stratification we found that for the snp rs2736100 the pvalue is 12391011 based on the armitage trend chisquare statistic with no stratification correction and the pvalue is 27641011 based on eigenstrat using ten principal components the default value for stratification correction there was a negligible difference in pvalues with and without this correction
 
the genotyping cluster plot generated by the illumina platform for rs2736100 is presented in figure s2 the adjusted intensities for each allele are plotted where each color represents a different genotype in the cluster plots as shown in the figure clusters of different genotypes are well separated from each other indicating a high confidence in genotype calling in our study the genotype call at this locus was confirmed with taqman genotyping concordance of 997
 
dna was extracted from blood samples and genotyped at the national cancer institute core genotyping facility cgf  for four studies snu kumc knuh and swhs taqman genotyping for the gelac study including all previously scanned cases and controls plus remaining neversmoking female cases and their matched controls and the gels studies was conducted in taiwan and singapore respectively genotyping for the camsch whlcs and njlcs studies were conducted at the cancer institute and hospital chinese academy of medical science using taqman assays designed and optimized by the cgf 
 
we selected fiftyfour snps optimized for eastern asian populations to cover the three chromosomal regions previously reported to show association for lung cancer ie fifteen snps in 5p15 fifteen snps in 6p and twentyfour snps in 15q25 table s3 the coordinates for selecting the tag snps were based on an r208 using the chb samples of hapmap phase two point the boundaries for the tag snp selection were as follows 5p1533 from one million three hundred and ten thousand six hundred and twenty to 1412939 6p2133 from twentyeight million seven hundred and eightytwo thousand seven hundred and seventysix to twentynine million eighteen thousand eight hundred and fiftysix and 15q25 from seventysix million five hundred and ninetythree thousand and seventyseven to seventysix million seven hundred and two thousand three hundred and one build 37 we computed genomic coverage using the glu software package  for common snps maf005 based on the most recent build build 37 of the hapmap chb 37 genotype data
 
all taqman assays applied biosystems inc foster city ca for this study were optimized on the abi 7900ht detection system with high concordance with sequence analysis of one hundred and two individuals as listed on the snp500cancer website  all of the genotype frequencies were consistent with hardyweinberg equilibrium except three snps rs402710 rs9368570 and rs9257280 using a chisquare test p00001 table s3 all reported genotyped results are based on completion rates of greater than 94 across all studies
 
the program plink 36 was used to conduct primary statistical tests for association in the discovery phase association analyses between individual snp and the lung cancer risk were carried out using computer packages in plink qq plots analyzed by the trend test are shown in figure one point we note that for phase 1 we imputed the genotypes at the snps contained in humanhap six hundred and ten quad beadchip but not in humancnv370duo beadchip by using impute developed by marchini et al 39 and haplotypes of chb in hapmap as the reference
 
unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the ors and 95 cis adjusting for age and study center all p values are twosided the most prevalent homozygous genotype was used as the reference group tests for trend were conducted by assigning the ordinal values 1 2 and three to the most prevalent genotypes in rank order of wild type heterozygous and variant homozygous genotypes respectively

we utilize an approach derived from that of bourgain et al 7 which has been discussed extensively in recent papers 35 this approach for accounting for relatedness between subjects in association tests adopts a retrospective approach towards the problem of testing for disease associations using marker data in which as in the armitage test the allele frequency of a variant is related to casecontrol status in vector notation we have of observed values for a given snp j here is the total number of subjects casescontrols in the study and snp values are coded as 012 for the number of copies of a specified allele  carried by subject  this coding of snp genotype implies that we are interested in additive models for the relationship between disease risk and genotype but the approach can readily be extended to other codings the retrospective approach models the mean of as a function of casecontrol status if we define the design matrix c to have rows 1 ci where ci is casecontrol status 0 or 1 for subject i then the mean  of is written asrelatedness between subjects induces a covariance matrix for the number of copies of a given snp of form1with specific to each snp but with the same matrix for all snps in fact for known pedigree relationships and unrelated founders this matrix has diagonal elements equal to where is the inbreeding coefficient for subject and each offdiagonal element  is twice the kinship coefficient for the relationship between subjects and 7
 
it is worth noting that in general the topic of relatedness includes what is often considered to be population substructure for example consider two large but isolated populations freely mixing within each population that have been separated for many generations while a random sample of people from the same population with sample size small relative to the population size might be considered unrelated to each other when considering that population separately when considering the two populations together people from one isolated population are considered to be related to each other relative to those in the other population in particular genetic markers will through a process of random drift and other factors be able to distinguish members from the two populations and this will be detectable when calculation of the matrix is performed a standard method of simulating genetic markers for divergent populations stemming from the same ancestral population eg the baldingnichols model 11 can readily be shown to produce covariance matrices of the form of expression 1
 
if and are both known then the best linear unbiased estimate blue of the regression vector is of weighted least squares formand the variance covariance matrix of the estimates is in the form ofthus inference on the significance of the allele frequency difference between cases and controls may be based upon the wald test statistic2with the 22 element of
 
in general of course and are not known except in the case of known pedigrees and unrelated founders where can be computed from first principles the estimation of using marker data has been considered by a number of authors and both method of moments 4 5 and maximum likelihood methods 3 have been considered a method of moments estimator of can be concisely written 5 as3and the estimate of asone value of this approach which is exploited here is that it is relatively easy to compute the power of the wald test if we can hypothesize a form of the relatedness matrix  for a given form for below we consider several forms for both isolated population models and more complex admixed populations then for a given sample size  a given allele frequency for a causal snp and a hypothesized difference in allele frequencies between cases and controls which can then be related to odds ratios in typical casecontrol analysis we can compute the noncentrality parameter of and hence the power of the test as4we illustrate the computation of this noncentrality parameter for a number of important special cases in the results section below it is worth noting now however that the bourgain test appears to be reasonably powerful compared to other procedures and can sometimes be considered as a compromise between the principal components method 8 and genomic control 12 we attempt to justify this last statement in the results section below
 
in addition to the bourgain test we used several well known tools for addressing population structure in the aabc data for example we computed eigenvectors through the use of the program eigenstrat 8 briefly each eigenvector explains a proportion of the genetic variation among samples in the analysis so that the leading eigenvector explains the greatest variation followed by the second eigenvector and so forth the full set of eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis so that each eigenvector is scaled on the unit interval and linearly independent from all other eigenvectors note that the eigenstrat procedure is operating on the same estimated matrix  that we have described above
 
to assess ancestry within the aabc study in relation to reference populations from hapmap we performed a principal components analysis based on ancestry informative markers that were genotyped in both the aabc study and the hapmap phase three populations the 2546 ancestry informative markers contained within the illumina 1m genotyping array which was used in the aabc scan were selected based on low intermarker correlation and high correlation to a previously determined eigenvector that explained african and european ancestry
 
we quantified percent african ancestry for each of the nine aabc study populations by running the program structure for each study population the program implements a markov chain monte carlo algorithm that provides the posterior estimates of the proportion of ancestry from each of k clusters for each individual where k is specified by the investigator for each aabc study population we assigned k  3 including genotypes from the same ancestry informative markers used in pca genotyped in yri ceu and jpt from hapmap phase three point

the ncbcfr is an ongoing populationbased family study conducted in the greater san francisco bay area and is one of six sites collaborating in the breast cancer family registry bcfr an international consortium funded by nci 16 african american breast cancer cases in ncbcfr were diagnosed after january 1 one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive and between the ages of eighteen and sixtyfour years population controls were identified through random digit dialing rdd stage one genotyping was conducted for four hundred and forty invasive african american cases and fiftythree african american controls
 
the cbcs is a populationbased casecontrol study conducted between one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree and two thousand and one in twentyfour counties of central and eastern north carolina 17 cases were identified by rapid case ascertainment system in cooperation with the north carolina central cancer registry and controls were selected from the north carolina division of motor vehicle and united states health care financing administration beneficiary lists participants ages ranged from twenty to seventyfour years for stage 1 dna samples were provided from six hundred and fiftysix african american cases with invasive breast cancer and six hundred and eight african american controls
 
plco coordinated by the us national cancer institute nci in ten us centers enrolled during 19932001 approximately 155000 men and women aged 5574 years in a randomized twoarm trial to evaluate the efficacy of screening for these four cancers 18 a total of sixtyfour african american invasive breast cancer cases and one hundred and thirtythree african american controls contributed to stage one of the gwas
 
the nbhs is a populationbased casecontrol study of incident breast cancer conducted in the tennessee 19 the study was initiated in two thousand and one to recruit patients with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ and controls recruited through rdd between the ages of twentyfive and seventyfive years nbhs contributed three hundred and ten african american invasive cases 57 in situ and one hundred and eightysix african american controls to the stage one analysis
 
african american breast cancer cases and controls in wfbc were recruited at wake forest university health sciences from november one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight through december two thousand and eight 20 controls were recruited from the patient population receiving routine mammography at the breast screening and diagnostic center age range of participants was 3086 years wfbc contributed one hundred and twentyfive cases 116 invasive and nine in situ and one hundred and fiftythree controls to the stage one analysis
 
genotyping in stage one was conducted using the illumina human1mduo beadchip of the 5984 samples from these studies 3153 cases and 2831 controls we attempted genotyping of 5932 removing samples n  52 with dna concentrations 20 ngul by pico green assay after clustering the genotype data we removed samples based on the following exclusion criteria 1 unknown replicates 989 genetically identical that we were able to confirm only one of each duplicate was removed n  15 2 unknown replicates that we were not able to confirm through discussions with study investigators pair or triplicate removed n  14 3 samples with call rates 95 after a second attempt n  100 4 samples with 5 african ancestry n  36 discussed below and 5 samples with 15 mean heterozygosity of snps in the x chromosome andor similar mean allele intensities of snps on the x and y chromosomes n  6 these are likely to be males
 
in the analysis we removed snps with 95 call rate or minor allele frequencies mafs 1 to assess genotyping reproducibility we included one hundred and thirtyeight replicate samples the average concordance rate was 9995 9993 for all pairs we also eliminated snps with genotyping concordance rates 98 based on the replicates the final analysis dataset included 3016 cases and 2745 controls with an average snp call rate of 997 and average sample call rate of 998 hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe was not used as a criterion for removing snps for this analysis

each sequenced sample was prepared according to the illumina protocols briefly one microgram of genomic dna was fragmented by nebulization the fragmented dna was repaired an a was ligated to the 3 end illumina adapters were then ligated to the fragments and the sample was size selected aiming for a 350400 base pair product the size selected product was pcr amplified and the final product was validated using the agilent bioanalyzer samples were then amplified on the flow cell and sequenced using the genome analyzer iix following the illumina supplied protocols the majority of sequence runs were paired end with seventyfive base reads we aimed for 7080 billion bases that passed the illumina analysis filter per genome
 
all sequencing data was produced and curated by the genomic analysis facility part of the center for human genome variation at duke university after the sequencing reactions were complete the illumina analysis pipeline was used to process the raw sequencing data firecrest bustard and gerald the resulting eland alignment was used only to estimate an error rate for each readcluster if a sequencing runlane had an error rate above 2 the run was considered a failure and the data was not used the quality of the sequencing runs were also assessed by evaluating the percentage of clusters passing filter and the percentage of reads that align to the reference genome for a typical run over 70 of clusters pass filter and over 85 align any major deviations from these values would trigger further evaluation average intensity error graphs etc and likely lead to these runslanes not being used the fastq files were then ready for the next alignment step
 
once the raw sequence data was curated the reads were aligned to a reference genome ncbi human genome assembly build 36 using the bwa software 1 each alignment was assigned a mapping quality score by bwa which is the phredscaled probability that the alignment is incorrect the pcr amplification step will lead to the sequencing of identical dna fragments not removing these pcr duplicates can lead to the miscalling of snvs by overrepresentation of one allele this is corrected by a quality control step to remove these potential pcr duplicates with samtools once all the reads have been aligned to the reference genome using bwa 1 we then used the samtools software 2 to produce a consensus genotype for each genomic position the consensus genotype is the genotype which has the highest probability of occurring after consideration of a number of factors 37 each consensus genotype is then assigned a consensus quality which is based on a phredscaled probability that the genotype call is incorrect single nucleotide variants snvs and insertiondeletions indels were then identified based on differences between the consensus genotype and the reference allele at that position samtools also assigns a phredscaled probability to each identified snvindel which indicates how likely it is that an inferred snvindel is identical to the reference these snvs and indels were then filtered by samtools variation filter changing only the maximum read depth parameter to call variants from its default value 100 to ten million to prevent the exclusion of snvs and indels at a read depth greater than one hundred point the lists of snvsindels were then annotated in the sequencevariantanalyzer sva 23 sva was specifically designed to annotate the large number of identified snvsindels using a number of human genomic databases in addition to looking at the snvsindels from the bwa alignmentsamtools we also predicted larger structural variation by developing an estimation by read depth with snvs or erds method based on a hidden markov model 17 this was an extension to the methods described in bentley et al 3 and draft codes from scally a 38 further details describing the analysis tools are presented in text s1
 
the raw reads for a portion of the genomes used in this study are available on the ncbi sequence read archive under study id srp001691  we do not have consent from the patients andor permission from the duke irb to release the raw reads for several of the genomes used in this study

the study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at vanderbilt university medical center and at each of the collaborating institutes informed consent was obtained from all participants
 
this study consisted of a discovery stage and two validation stages ie an in silico and a de novo validation study the overall study design is presented in figure s1
 
the discovery stage included 1019 t2d cases eight hundred and eightysix incident t2d cases from the shanghai womens health study swhs an ongoing populationbased prospective cohort study of women living in shanghai and one hundred and thirtythree prevalent t2d cases identified among controls of the shanghai breast cancer study sbcs who were recruited in shanghai during approximately the same period as the swhs 11 controls for the discovery phase were 1710 nondiabetic female controls from the sbcs for further details see text s1 online the biologic samples used for genotyping in this study were collected by the swhs and sbcs
 
dna samples were genotyped using the affymetrix genomewide human snp array 60 extensive quality control qc procedures were implemented in the study in the swhssbcs gwas scan three positive qc samples purchased from coriell cell repositories and a negative qc sample were included in each of the 96well plates of the affymetrix snp array 60 snp data obtained from positive quality control samples showed a very high concordance rate of called genotypes based on 79764872 comparisons mean 9987 median 100 samples with genotyping call rates less than 95 were excluded the sex of all study samples was confirmed to be female the identitybydescent analysis based on identity by state was performed to detect firstdegree cryptic relationships using plink version one point zero six 12 we excluded from the study twentyone samples that had 1 call rate 95 n  5 2 samples that were contaminated or had mixedup labels or that had been duplicated n  12 3 firstdegree relatives such as parentoffspring or full siblings n  4
 
we also excluded from the analysis snps that met any of following criteria 1 maf 005 2 call rate 95 3 p for hardyweinburg equilibrium hwe 000001 in either the case or control groups or in the combined data set 4 concordance rate 95 among the duplicated qc samples 5 significant difference in allele frequency distribution p000001 between the eight hundred and eightysix t2d cases from the swhs and the one hundred and thirtythree t2d cases from the sbcs 6 significant difference in missing rates between cases and controls p000001 after applying the qc filter 590887 snps remained for the analyses
 
because of financial constraints we conducted a fasttrack validation study using an approach that combined in silico and de novo replication we selected a total of 2100 snps from the discovery phase that had pvalues of 13109 to 50103 derived from the additive model and that were not in linkage disequilibrium ld r202 based on the hapmap chb dataset with any previously reported t2d gwas snps for an in silico replication using the gwas scan data from the nhshpfs 2 we used the nhshpfs t2d gwas scans for our first step of validation because the shanghai t2d gwas was conducted concurrently and used the same genotyping platform as the nhshpfs t2d gwas and a priori arrangement was made for the two studies to exchange the top 2000 snps for in silico replication the nhshpfs t2d gwas included 2591 cases and 3052 controls of european ancestry we recognize that this approach may have reduced our chances of finding ethnicityspecific t2d markers however this approach had the advantage of enhancing our ability of finding true genetic markers from the first in silico replication sixtyfive snps with the same direction of association in both studies and with a maf 20 were chosen for a second in silico replication using gwas scan data from a korean t2d study which included 1042 cases and 2943 controls genotyped with the affymetrix genomewide human snp array five point zero platform in order to improve yield only the top snps that are included in affymetrix five point zero n  56 or that are in high ld r208 with at least one snp on affymetrix five point zero n  9 were selected for replication table s1 of the sixtyfive snps the top eight snps replicated in the korean t2d study were further investigated using gwas data from a t2d study conducted among singapore chinese 2010 cases and 1945 controls who were genotyped by using illumina humanhap six hundred and ten or illumina human1m table s2 four of the eight snps were not directly genotyped in the singapore study so instead we selected snps that are in strong ld with these four snps imputed snp information became available recently and is presented in this report finally the five top snps rs2815429 rs10906115 rs1359790 rs10751301 and rs1436955 were selected for de novo genotyping in an independent sample set of 1645 t2d cases and 1649 controls identified from the swhs and shanghai mens health study smhs four of these snps rs10906115 rs1359790 rs10751301 and rs1436955 were selected for the final stage of de novo genotyping replication in two independent chinese studies the wuhan diabetes study wds 1063 cases and 1408 controls and the nutrition and health of aging population in china nhapc study 424 cases and 1908 controls detailed descriptions of the study designs and populations for each of the participating studies are presented in text s1 online
 
genotyping for the five snps included in the swhs and smhs sample set was completed using the iplex sequenom massarray platform included in each 96well plate as quality control samples were two negative controls two blinded duplicates and two samples included in the hapmap project we also included sixtyfive subjects who had been genotyped by the affymetrix snp array six point zero in the sequenom genotyping the consistency rate was 100 for all snps for the blinded duplicates compared with the hapmap data and compared with data from the affymetrix snp array 60 genotyping for the final four snps in the wds and nhapc was completed using taqman assays at the two local institute laboratories using reagents provided by the vanderbilt molecular epidemiology laboratory both laboratories were asked to genotype a trial plate provided by the vanderbilt molecular epidemiology laboratory that contained dna from seventy chinese samples before the main study genotyping was conducted the consistency rates for these trial samples were 100 compared with genotypes previously determined at vanderbilt for all four snps in both local laboratories in addition replicate samples comparing 37 of all study samples were dispersed among genotyping plates for both studies
 
the imputation of ungenotyped snps in all participating gwass was carried out after the completion of the current study using the programs mach  or impute  with hapmap asian data as the reference for asians and ceu data as the reference for europeanancestry samples only data with high imputation quality rsqr 03 for mach were included in the current analysis
 
plink version one point zero six was used to analyze genomewide data obtained in the sbcsswhs gwas scan population structure was evaluated by principal component analysis using eigenstrat  set of 12533 snps with a maf 10 in chinese samples and a distance of 25 kb between two adjacent snps was selected to evaluate the population structure the first two principal components were included in the logistic regression models for adjustment of population structures the inflation factor  was estimated to be 103 suggesting that population substructure if present should not have any appreciable effect on the results
 
pooled and metaanalyses were carried out in sas to derive combined odds ratios or by using data from studies of all stages we applied the weighted zstatistics method where weights are proportional to the square root of the number of subjects in each study results from both random and fixed effect models are presented
 
ors and 95 confidence intervals ci were estimated using logistic regression models with adjustment for age bmi population structure for gwas data and gender when appropriate analyses with additional adjustment for smoking were conducted by pooled analysis whenever possible and by metaanalysis when kare data were included in order to examine the confounding and modification effects of these factors table s2 genotype distributions for the top four snps included in the final de novo genotyping were consistent with hwe p 005 in each study all p values presented are based on twotailed tests except where indicated otherwise

a total of twentyfive fungus gardens from five healthy colonies 5 gardens each of the leafcutter ant atta colombica were collected at the end of may and beginning of june two thousand and eight point these colonies are located along pipeline road in soberania national park panama latitude 9 7 0 n longitude 79 42 0 w and designated n9 n11 n12 n13 and n14 respectively each fungus garden was vertically crosssectioned into thirds with the top third designated as the top of the garden and the bottom third designated as the bottom of the garden all material was frozen and transported back to the university of wisconsinmadison where it was stored at 20c prior to processing
 
from all five colonies 3 gardens per colony five independent samples from fungus garden tops and bottoms of each garden were collected for sugar composition analysis thus a total of seventyfive fungus garden samples each from the top and bottom were used for this part of our study this material was tested for crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose matrix polysaccharide content as follows
 
cellulose content of fungus garden plant biomass was determined by first washing each sample using updegraff reagent 31 which removes matrix polysaccharides such as hemicelluloses pectins and amorphous glucan the remaining residue containing only crystalline cellulose was hydrolyzed using saeman hydrolysis 32 the resulting glucose monosaccharides were then quantified with an anthrone colourmetric assay as previously described 32
 
for the composition of the matrix polysaccharide content the following components were tested arabinose fucose galactose glucose rhamnose mannose and xylose quantification of these sugars were performed by treating finely ground materials with solvents to remove pigments proteins lipids and dna from the material as previous described 33 the residue was destarched with an amylase treatment resulting in only cell wall material this material was then treated with 2m trifluoroacetic acid solubilizing the matrix polysaccharides in form of their monosaccharides and subsequently derivatized into their corresponding alditolacetates which were separated and quantified by gcms as previously described 34
 
the same set of samples used for sugar composition analysis was also used for lignin content analysis as previously described 35 briefly all samples were dried to 60c and ground using a 1mm cyclone mill and analyzed for total nonlignin organic matter lignin and ash organic and inorganic content total carbohydrate content was assessed through a twostep acid hydrolysis with neutral sugars quantified using gc and uronic acids quantified using colorimetry klason lignin was quantified from the ashfree residue from the twostep acid hydrolysis ash content was quantified by combustion at 450c for eighteen h and the average gmg of material was calculated
 
total dna was extracted in preparation for either 16s rdna sequencing or community metagenomic sequencing for 16s rdna sequencing a total of five gardens each from three atta colombica colonies n9 n11 and n12 were used a total of one g wet weight of fungus garden material was sampled from the top layer of each garden corresponding to each colony for a combined final weight of five g of fungus garden material total dna from this sample was then extracted using a mobio power soil dna extraction kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa the same procedures were performed for all fungus garden bottom layer samples for all three colonies
 
for community metagenomic sequencing total community dna was extracted from five whole fungus gardens each from all five atta colombica colonies used in this study a total of one g of fungus garden material was sampled from top middle and bottom layers from all fungus gardens and combined to produce a final sample weight of seventyfive g this material was then enriched for bacteria using a modification of a previouslydescribed protocol 36 briefly total fungus garden material was buffered in 1x pbs 137 mm nacl two point seven mm kcl ten mm na2hpo4 two mm kh2po4 containing 01 tween and then centrifuged for five minutes at 40g this resulted in a 3layer mixture containing leafmaterial at the top fungal mass in the middle and bacteria at the bottom the top and middle layers were carefully removed buffered with 1x pbs containing 01 tween and washed using the same centrifugation method an additional three times the final mixture was then centrifuged for thirty minutes at 2800g resuspended in 1x pbs containing 01 tween and filtered through a one hundred um filter total dna from this resulting sample was then extracted using a qiagen dneasy plant maxi kit qiagen sciences germantown md usa

assembled fulllength 16s contigs were first compared against the national center for biotechnological informations ncbi nonredundant nucleotide nt and environmental nucleotide envnt databases accessed 05012009 using blast 37 to verify that all sequences were bacterial a small number of eukaryotic 18s sequences belonging to the fungus the ants cultivate leucoagaricus gongylophorus which were likely amplified due to the crossreactivity of the 16s primers were removed no sequences identified as archaeal were detected from our library generated using archaealspecific primers and only bacterial sequences were amplified sequences were prepared for alignment by orienting each sequence in the same direction using the computer program orientation checker 38 putative chimeras were removed using bellerophon 39 and each set was dereplicated to remove exact duplicates
 
finalized sets for each sample were then analyzed using the arb 40 software environment as follows all fulllength 16s rdna sequences were imported and then aligned using the arb fastaligner tool 40 against a userconstructed ptserver constructed from the silva 41 16s ssu rdna preconfigured arb reference database with 7682 columns and 134095 bacterial sequences accessed 01152009 the full alignment was manually curated using the arbprimary editor arbedit4 in preparation for phylogenetic and community analysis once an acceptable alignment was obtained we created a phylip 42 distance matrix in arb using the filterbybasefrequency method column filter minimal similarity  50 gaps ignored if occurred in 50 of the samples 1320 valid columns the phylip distance matrix was exported to the mothur software package v150 43 for community analysis and otu designation briefly the distance matrix was read into mothur and clustered using the furthest neighbor algorithm from here we performed rarefaction rankabundance species abundance and shared analyses representative sequences from each otu at 97 were reimported into arb for phylogenetic analysis figure s4 s5 s6 s7 and s8 we used a maximum likelihood raxml 44 method for all phylogenetic analyses normal hillclimbing search algorithm and the abovementioned method for positional filtering closest taxonomic assignment of clones was performed using the ribosomal database project rdp 45 by comparing sequences against the type strain database table s5
 
for pyrotagged shortread 16s rdna sequences all sequences were compared against the national center for biotechnological informations ncbi nonredundant nucleotide nt and environmental nucleotide envnt databases accessed 05012009 using blastn sequences were then classified as either bacterial archaeal or eukaryotic and only those bacterial sequences 20330 were retained for further analysis
 
these sequences were then processed through orientation checker chimeras removed using the program mallard 38 and subsequently analyzed using mothur in the following fashion first the entire dataset was dereplicated to eliminate duplicate sequences the remaining sequences were aligned in mothur against the greengenes 46 reference alignment coresetalignedimputedfasta 7682 columns accessed 09112009 using the needleman alignment method with the following parameters ktuple size  9 match  1 mismatch penalty  3 gap extension penalty  1 gap opening penalty  5 sequences were then screened to eliminate those shorter than four hundred bp gaps included filtration eliminated 7062 columns resulting in a total alignment size of six hundred and twenty bp gaps included the remaining dataset was again dereplicated to eliminate duplicate sequences and we constructed a furthestneighbor distance matrix in mothur using the twice dereplicated filtered alignment all subsequent analyses rarefaction rankabundance species abundance and shared analyses were performed in mothur using this distance matrix
 
a unifrac 15 analysis was performed on all fulllength 16s rdna samples generated in this study including three from the top and three from the bottom of fungus gardens mothur was used to generate phylip distance matrices and the computer program clearcut 47 was then employed to construct neighborjoining trees unifrac was then used to compare these samples as shown in figure s3
 
whole community dna was used to create a shotgun library which was then sequenced using a single pyrosequencing plate on a roche four hundred and fiftyfour flx gs titanium sequencer assembly of the data was performed using the four hundred and fiftyfour de novo assembler software with default parameters total amounts of data generated and statistical coverage is presented in table s2 raw sequence reads generated for this microbiome are deposited in ncbis short read archive under study accession srp0010111 and assembled contigs and singletons have been deposited into ddbjemblgenbank under the accession adwx00000000
 
the complete set of assembled contigs and singletons representing the fungus garden community metagenome was phylogenetically binned using the following approach first the metagenome was compared against ncbis nonredundant nucleotide nt and environmental nucleotide envnt databases accessed 05012009 using blastn evalue 1e05 and the top hit was retained the designated phylogenetic classification of the top hit for each contig and singleton was then assessed and binned into one of the following four sets bacterial eukaryotic viral or unknown we then performed indepth phylogenetic binning of the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome using the current microbial genome collection  accessed 05152009 we reasoned that using the current microbial genome collection is a likely a more accurate metric for classifying the bacterial set at the genus level because each genome in this collection is correctly annotated and the current iteration of this collection contains both phylogenetic breadth and depth for many represented genera as a result we performed two different phylogenetic bins using the current microbial genome collection
 
first genemark 48 was used to predict open reading frames and their corresponding translated proteins of the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome using a generic bacterial gene model this predicted proteome was then compared against a local database containing all proteomes in the current microbial genome collection  accessed 05152009 supplemented with the predicted proteomes of two bacterial strains klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b see below isolated from the fungus gardens of a related leafcutting ant species atta cephalotes comparison of the fungus garden proteome against our microbial reference database was done using blastp evalue 1e05 and the phylogenetic identity of the top hit was recorded the total number of proteins was then tabulated to the genus level total nucleotide coding content for each predicted protein was then calculated to determine the total amount of nucleotide represented in each bin
 
second we performed phylogenetic binning on the bacterial portion of the fungus garden metagenome using the entire nucleotide content of the current microbial genome collection  accessed 05152009 and again supplemented with the nucleotide content from the draft genome sequences of our two bacterial isolates from atta cephalotes leafcutter ant fungus gardens using complete nucleotide content of the current microbial genome collection is advantageous because it includes both coding and intergenic regions and provides a more robust measure of phylogenetic identity we compared the entire bacterial portion of the fungus garden metagenome against this database using blastn evalue 1e05 and the phylogenetic identity of the top hit was recorded the total number of contigs and singletons was then tabulated to the genus level and the corresponding nucleotide amounts were also calculated furthermore we performed this same analysis using all highquality reads from our fungus garden community metagenome finally we employed the phylogenetic binning program phymmbl 22 which resulted in similar phylogenetic binning results as our comparison against the sequenced genome collection
 
we performed gc content analysis on the bacterial eukaryotic and unclassified phylogenetic bins of the leafcutter ant fungus garden community metagenome for the bacterial set we divided the sequences according to the ncbi taxonomic groups acidobacteria actinobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes proteobacteria and proteobacteria we then calculated their gc content and tabulated the total number of sequences within each group corresponding to each percentage as shown in figure s11 for eukaryotic sequences these were divided into fungal metazoan and plant classifications and gc content analysis was also performed as shown in figure s12 furthermore this same analysis was performed for the unclassified portion of the community metagenome and plotted alongside our eukaryotic gc content analysis
 
the predicted proteome from the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome was annotated using the carbohydrate active enzyme cazy database 23 as follows a local database of all proteins corresponding to each cazy family from the cazy online database  accessed 06012009 was constructed and this was used to align the predicted proteome of the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome using blastp evalue of 1e05 this proteome was then annotated against the protein family pfam 49 database ftpftpncbinihgovpubmmdbcdd accessed 05012009 using rpsblast 50 evalue 1e05 a cazy to pfam correlation list was then compiled based on the secondary annotations provided through the cazy online database finally only those proteins that had significant blast hits to a protein from our local cazy database and its corresponding pfam were retained and designated as a carbohydrateassociated enzyme
 
a similar process was performed using the eukaryotic portion of the fungus garden metagenome however because of the difficulty in accurately predicting proteins from this subset due to the lack of good gene models we compared the contigs and singletons in this subset to our local cazy and pfam databases using blastx evalue 1e05 only those hits with significant matches to a protein from our local cazy database and its corresponding pfam were retained and designated as a carbohydrateassociated enzyme in this set
 
to determine the similarity of the fungus garden community metagenome with respect to other sequenced metagenomes we performed a comparative analysis using protein domain and carbohydrate enzyme content as a comparative metric as previously described 51 in general the predicted proteome from the bacterial portion of the fungus garden metagenome was annotated according to clusters of orthologous groups cogs 52 database ftpftpncbinihgovpubmmdbcdd accessed 05012009 using rpsblast evalue 1e05 the predicted proteomes from the following thirteen metagenomes were also annotated in the same manner bovine rumen 3 chicken cecum 53 fish gut and slime 54 gutless worm 55 human gut gill 6 human gut kurokawa 56 minnesota soil 51 lean mouse 5 obese mouse 5 termite hindgut 2 wastewater sludge usa 57 sastewater sludge oz 57 and whale fall 51 the cog profiles from all of these metagenomes were divided according to their cog gene category designations and plotted as a proportion as shown in figure s13 cluster analysis of cog profiles for these metagenomes were performed as follows a matrix was generated with each row corresponding to a metagenome and each column corresponding to a cog id the proportion of each cog with respect to the total number of annotated cogs in that metagenome was calculated and populated in the appropriate cell of the matrix spearmans rank correlation was then applied to this matrix to generate a similarity matrix correlating each metagenome to each other based on the similarity of each metagenomes cog profile a distance matrix was then calculated using the neighbor program from the computer suite phylip 42 using the upgma method and the resulting unrooted tree was visualized using the phylodendron tree drawing program  accessed 07252009 this same analysis was also performed using protein domains pfam and no discernable difference in metagenome groupings was detected data not shown
 
a similar approach was used for clustering these metagenomes according to cazy content each metagenomes predicted proteome was annotated using cazy and correlated to its pfam annotation as described above because each protein potentially encodes for domain that belong to multiple cazy families ie a protein may contain both a gh and a cbm we assigned multiple cazy annotations to a particular protein a carbohydrate enzyme matrix was then constructed with each row corresponding to a metagenome sample and each column corresponding to a cazy family each cell in this matrix was then populated with the proportion of each cazy family with respect to the total number of annotated cazy families in each respective metagenome generation of an unrooted tree using this matrix was then constructed using the same procedure outlined for clustering based on the protein domain content metric
 
pure isolates of klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b were cultured from the fungus gardens of the leafcutter ant atta cephalotes as previously described 10 genomic dna from these isolates were extracted as previously described 10 draft genomes of klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b were sequenced at the us department of energy joint genome institute jgi using a random shotgun approach through a combination of four hundred and fiftyfour standard and pairedend pyrosequencing 454 life sciences a roche company and thirtysix bp read illumina sequencing illumina inc sequencing using four hundred and fiftyfour was performed to an average depth of coverage of 30x for both klebsiella and pantoea all general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the jgi can be found at  a draft assembly for klebsiella variicola at22 was compiled based on 459192 reads for pantoea sp at9b a draft assembly was constructed using 557748 reads the phredphrapconsed software package  was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment of both drafts 5860 after the shotgun stage reads were assembled with parallel phrap high performance software llc automated annotation of these draft genomes were performed by the computational biology and bioinformatics group of the biosciences division of the us department of energy oak ridge national laboratory as described at  the draft genome sequence and annotation for klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b were deposited in genbank under accession numbers cp001891 and acyj00000000 respectively
 
the full set of reads used for the assembly of the fungus garden community metagenome was used to generate a recruitment plot against the draft genomes of klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b two isolates we cultured from the fungus garden of the leafcutter ant atta cephalotes 10 as previously described 27  briefly the contigs from each draft genome were concatenated together in ascending size to produce a pseudogenome and the reads from the fungus garden community metagenome were aligned against a database containing both pseudogenomes and all genomes from the current microbial genome collection  accessed 05152009 using blastn the top hit for each read was retained and categorized to each genome we then mapped reads corresponding to klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b onto each organisms respective psuedogenome and further binned them according to their sequence identities as follows 95100 9095 8590 8085 and 7080 visualization of the mapped reads onto each respective draft genome was performed using the dnaplotter software package 61
 
a cazy analysis was performed on the predicted proteomes of klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b using the same approach as described for cazy analysis of the leafcutter ant fungus garden community metagenome furthermore both gh8 cellulases from each of these genomes were compared against the cazyme of the fungus garden community metagenome at the nucleotide level using blastn evalue 1e05
 
bioassays were performed on pure cultures of klebsiella variicola at22 and pantoea sp at9b to determine their capacity to degrade cellulose these include carboxymethyl cellulose cmc assays and growth on microcrystalline cellulose cmc assays were performed as previously described 62 briefly pure cultures of both bacteria were inoculated onto yeast malt extract agar ymea four g yeast extract ten g bacto peptone four g dextrose fifteen g agar and grown at 25c for two days single colonies were then spotted onto carboxymethyl cellulose plates 15 g agar five g carboxymethyl cellulose calbiochem la jolla ca detection of cellulose degradation on cmc was performed using congo red and the ability of each isolates capacity for cellulose degradation was measured based on the zone of clearing present on the plate growth on microcrystalline cellulose was performed by inoculating ten l of pure culture into one hundred and fifty l of microcrystalline cellulose broth 1 l water and five g cellulose powder microcrystalline cellulose mp biomedicals solon oh and growth was measured using a dtx eight hundred and eighty multimode detector plate reader beckman coulter inc fullerton ca at an absorbance of five hundred and ninetyfive for two days positive growth on microcrystalline cellulose was correlated to an increase in the measured absorbance over this period

anonymized samples for this study were derived from allogeneic blood donor samples that already existed and would otherwise be discarded as the samples were provided anonymously the nih office of human subjects research approved the use of these samples on an exemption basis per federal code 45cfr46 without the need for irb review or informed consent
 
the complete erap2 coding region and some exonadjacent intronic regions 8794 bp total two thousand eight hundred and eightythree bp of which are protein coding were sequenced in one hundred and eighty individuals from six geographically diverse human groups specifically we studied thirty individuals from each of the following hapmap 76 populations yoruba nigeria luhya kenya gujarati indians living in houston tx usa han china and toscani italy as a representative middle eastern population we also studied thirty palestinian israel individuals from the national laboratory for the genetics of israeli populations telaviv university the same one hundred and eighty individuals were also used for sequencing portions of the erap1 gene 9753 bp total two thousand eight hundred and fortyseven bp of coding sequence the regions sequenced are shown in figure s1
 
regions of interest were pcramplified and sequenced bidirectional sangerbased sequencing and snps were detected with polyphredpolyphrap to minimize sequencing errors variants residing within the first and last fifty bp of each amplified segment were discarded additionally we manually reviewed all variants associated with discordant results between overlapping amplimers variants with a quality score lower than 99 singletons and triallelic snps the ancestry of each snp was inferred through comparison with the chimpanzee orangutan and macaque genome sequences 77 78 genomeucscedu fixed differences with chimpanzee were identified by comparison with the chimpanzee genome sequence 77
 
as a proxy for neutrality we sequenced fortyseven control regions such regions consisted of unlinked ancient processed pseudogenes that do not encode a functional protein and are thus expected to evolve in a neutral fashion the control regions are not part of gene families are far from genes do not overlap putative functional elements are conserved as pseudogenes in chimpanzees orangutans and macaques and have recombination rates and gc contents similar to coding genes details about these control regions can be found in the text s1
 
the generated sequence data were analyzed using three neutrality tests mwuhigh tajimas d and hka mwuhigh 37 compares the sfs of a region of interest with the sfs of a neutral regions eg control regions to determine whether the former is consistent with neutral expectations 37 specifically we applied mwuhigh to the folded sfs which becomes significant only in the case of an excess of intermediatefrequency alleles 3 tajimas d 38 compares two estimates of  the scaled mutation rate and when significantly positive identifies genealogies with long internal branches consistent with longterm balancing selection finally hka 39 identifies regions with an unusual density of polymorphisms when compared with divergence and with the patterns of neutral loci for the hka test we focused only on coding regions and used the chimpanzee as an outgroup mwuhigh was calculated using an inhouse c script while tajimas d and hka were calculated using libsequence 79
 
the significance of all neutrality tests was assessed by 10000 coalescent simulations with ms 80 selecting an appropriate demographic model for the simulations is crucial to avoid spurious detection of signatures of selection our null model followed a recently published demographic scenario that included african asian and european populations 81 and that was a better fit to our control data than previously proposed demographic models the divergence to chimpanzee was adjusted in the simulations to fit the ratio of snps to fixed differences of the control regions simulations were conditioned on the total number of informative sites and the recombination rate was set to 106 per base pair the estimated recombination rate of this genomic region genomeucscedu all analyses were performed with an inhouse perl program neutrality test pipeline
 
haplotypes of the coding snps were inferred using phase 82 and the haplotype network was created with network 83 the estimated age of the haplotypes was calculated using network and calibrated with chimpanzee considering a divergence time of six mya
 
we analyzed the erap2 cdna from lcls of hapmap yoruba individuals with different genotypes aahomozygotes gm18504 gm18505 gm11832 and gm07000 bbhomozygotes gm18507 gm19240 gm12891 and gm12892 or abheterozygotes gm18861 gm18870 gm19137 and gm19201 the cell lines were obtained from the corriell cell repositories ccrcoriellorg total rna was isolated from each cell line using trizol reagent invitrogen and the rneasy miniprep kit qiagen cdna was synthesized from one g of total rna using the superscript iii first strand reverse transcriptase kit and random hexamers invitrogen the erap2 fulllength transcript exons one to 19 was amplified using expand high fidelity pcr system roche from cdna prepared from lcls that were aahomozygote gm18504 or bbhomozygote gm18508 these pcr products were cloned into the pcr4topo vector invitrogen and at least six clones for each haplotype were sequenced 3100 genetic analyzer applied biosystems primer sequences for this experiment and for the exon ten splicevariant screening can be found in table s4
 
the effect of rs2248374 on erap2 mrna splicing was assessed using two in silico methods first we used geneid 46 to predict the splicing of mrna derived from the two haplotypes text s1 second we used maxent 47 to predict the splicing potential of the constitutive splice site with 1 the a allele atggtaagg and 2 the g allele atggtgagg
 
western blot analysis was performed as previously described 84 briefly protein extracts from approximately 3103 cells were separated on a 412 nupage bistris gel invitrogen at one hundred and twentyfive v for one hundred minutes in 1 nupage mes sds running buffer invitrogen after transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane proteins were detected using a 15000 dilution of primary antibody goat antierap2 polyclonal antibody af3830 rd systems and mouse antierap2 polyclonal ab69037 abcam antiactin monoclonal prepared in mouse a5316 sigma and a 110000 dilution of secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase hrp goat antimouse igg sc2005 santa cruz biotechnology and donkey antigoat igg sc2020 santa cruz biotechnology proteins were then visualized by autoradiography after treatment with substrate to hrp thermo scientific for five minutes the ratio of the intensity of the fulllength erap2 band of aahomozygotes to abheterozygotes was calculated using imagej rsbwebnihgovijindexhtml
 
abheterozygote lcls were treated with one hundred gml of emetine sigma for seven hours to inhibit nmd 50 parallel cultures were left untreated and grown at standard conditions total rna was prepared from each cell line and used to generate cdna as described earlier we quantified haplotypespecific erap2 cdna in triplicate using an allelediscriminating taqman genotyping assay for three coding diagnostic snps c328274920 for rs2549782 c2564953010 for rs2548538 and c2564951610 for rs2287988 applied biosystems as previously described 85 briefly for each allelespecific assay we generated a standard curve consisting of serial dilutions of two hapmap genomic dna samples homozygous for either the haplotype a gm18504 or haplotype b gm18508 allele we used a heterozygous genomic dna sample gm18861 to validate the regression equation in which we expect to see a mean allelic ratio of one point zero since both the haplotypea and haplotypeb alleles are present in an equal proportion
 
two experiments labeled one and two in figure 6 were performed with sixteen samples each human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs were isolated from buffy coats using a ficollhistopaque gradient lonza pbmcs were washed and cultured using rpmi one thousand six hundred and forty supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum 1 penicillin and streptomycin zero point two m lglutamine and twenty mm hepes surface staining was measured by flow cytometry using fluorescencelabeled antibodies specific to cd19 labeled with apc clone hib19 ebioscience and hlaabc labeled with fitc clone w632 ebioscience which reacts to hlaa b and c flowcytometry data analysis was performed with flojo software treestar specifically we measured hlaabc mfis from a population of b cells gated by cd19 a constitutive bcell marker intensity gating and analysis were carried out blindly with respect to genotypes in order to standardize hlaabc mfi in light of the intrinsic variability among human samples a standardized hlaabc measure was calculated for each sample by dividing the hlaabc mfi by the cd19 mfi for each sample the values were partitioned by experiment and subpartitioned by genotype within each of these groups outliers were removed defined as samples with values under or over 15times the interquartile range it is worth noting that the inclusion of outliers did not affect the results two sets of analyses were performed for each of these three measures hlaabc cd19 and standardized hlaabc as the dependent variable first a ttest was used to detect differences between cells with aa and bb genotypes for each experiment second a twofactor anova was performed for each measure using the data generated with all aa or bb samples where the two factors of the anova were genotype and experiment genotyping was performed by pcr amplification and sequencing of dna prepared from the pbmcs dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen using primers flanking rs2248374 see table s4 for primer sequences

all carriers were recruited to studies table 2 at the host institutions under irbapproved protocols
 
a total of 6272 brca2 carriers from thirtynine studies table 2 and fourteen countries contributed dna samples for this project with the exception of nicc all studies are members of the consortium of investigators of modifiers of brca12 cimba 28 recruitment of carriers were conducted predominantly through cancer genetics clinics and enrolled through national or regional efforts other studies were recruited through populationbased or communitybased ascertainments all subjects provided written informed consent eligible female carriers were aged eighteen years or older were selfreported white and had mutations in brca2 data were available on age at study recruitment age at cancer diagnosis age of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy brca12 mutation description and selfreported ethnicity only a limited number of cases had detailed information on tumor characteristics eg estrogen and progesterone receptor status therefore subtype analyses were not performed at this stage
 
all eligible dna samples provided by participating centers were subjected to a rigorous quality control assessment including measures of overall dna quality and quantity a total of 1156 young 50 years affected women and 1038 unaffected women with high quality dna samples were selected table 2 for time efficiency stage one genotyping occurred in two phases phase one included four hundred and twentyone cases and four hundred and four controls and phase two included seven hundred and thirtyfive cases and six hundred and thirtyfour controls
 
prior to the genomewide scan we genotyped five snps previously genotyped by the cimba study centers as a prefilter for sample identification thirtyone samples figure s1 were discordant in the two genotyping rounds and were excluded from further analysis
 
the genotyping for the stage one gwas was performed on 2163 eligible carriers using the affymetrix six point zero genechip array that included 906622 snps figure s1 to further monitor the identity of the dna samples a fingerprinting panel of fourteen snps with a minor allele frequency 10 in hapmap european individuals were genotyped on all samples using sequenom iplex before and after affymetrix genotyping the amg gender assay was used for gender assessment as an additional quality control measure cases and controls were interleafed on each plate to eliminate technical bias each plate also included one hapmap ceu dna sample
 
the dna samples and genotyping calls for both phases of stage one were filtered through a series of data quality control parameters using the birdseed module of the birdsuite software developed at broad institute 29 among the 2163 samples genotyped in the stage one gwas two hundred and fiftythree failed to hybridize to the chip due to poor dna quality and were excluded figure s1 fiftyfive samples were dropped with call rates 95 three samples were contaminated fortythree were identified by genotyping to be duplicates and four were male all were dropped from analyses
 
snps were also filtered using birdseed and were removed if monomorphic or 10 missing n  38962 genotype call rates 95 n  50810 minor allele frequencies 1 n  104792 departures from hardyweinberg equilibrium p106 n  1090 differential missingness with respect to phenotype p103 n  275 and differential missingness with respect to nearby snps p1010 n  22065 a total of 6212 snps had different missingness patterns in phase one compared to phase 2 and were excluded since we found that significant missingness correlated to snps mapping to longer fragments of affymetrix six point zero digestion products we also removed the snps on fragments longer than 1000bp n  85990
 
with the remaining 1805 carriers and 596426 snps an iterative process proceeded to drop all individuals with low call rates 95 high autosomal heterozygosity rates false discovery rate 01 and high identity by descent scores 095 and to drop all snps with minor allele frequencies 1 and snp call rates 95 until the final run contained individuals above the individual and snp filter thresholds n  1747 samples and 592566 snps a more stringent hwe filter p107 was then applied and four hundred and three additional snps were dropped nine individuals with missing mutation descriptions were removed
 
finally principal components analysis was used to identify the ethnic outliers figure s5 a total of 1743 brca2 mutation carriers and the hapmap3 data for two hundred and ten individuals of european ceu han chinese chb and yoruba yri african descent were available for multidimensional scaling using the genomic kinship matrix estimated using a set of 53641 autosomal and uncorrelated snps a cutoff of 11 was used to exclude samples with nonceu ancestry n  35 genotypephenotype association analyses were based on 1703 899 young affected and eight hundred and four unaffected brca2 mutation carriers and 592163 snps covering 85 of the common hapmap three snps imputed with see below including 64 of the markers that were removed in the qc process
 
where directly genotyped data were not available probabilities were imputed with beagle302 using the default parameters using ceutsi samples on hapmap3 release2 b36 as the reference panel 410 chromosomes one point four m snps
 
the primary snp selection strategy was based on the results of the kinshipadjusted score test of 592163 gwas genotyped snps from stage 1 a total of seventynine top independent regions  with pairwise r2 values080 were selected for genotyping in stage two figure s6 for the top ten snps if available an additional correlated snp pairwise  n  5 was selected to serve as genotyping backup the remaining snps for stage two were selected based on two alternate strategies first we added the fourteen as well as fgfr2 counted in the top ten snps above confirmed breast cancer snps from prior independent gwas of sporadic breast cancer second we also selected the fifteen top independent regions pairwise  based on the ranking of the pvalues from a logistic regression analysis of one point five million imputed snps in total for stage two replication phase we selected one hundred and thirteen snps and 1524 breast cancer carriers and 1508 control carriers table 2 for genotyping using the sequenom iplex platform
 
samples were excluded for call rates 95 n  476 duplication in stage two identity by state ibs10 n  43 duplication in stage one and two ibs n  25 lack of complete phenotype data n  1 and insufficient countryspecific numbers n  1 figure s6 a total of one hundred snps were successfully multiplexed into three pools the remaining thirteen snps were not genotyped genotyping qc filters excluded fifteen snps due to call rates 90 n  14 and maf1 n  1 in summary the final association analyses in stage two were based on 2486 carriers 1264 affected and 1222 unaffected carriers and eightyfive snps
 
carriers were censored at the first breast or ovarian cancer or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy whichever occurred first carriers who developed any cancer were censored at time of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy if it occurred more than a year prior to the cancer diagnosis to avoid censoring at bilateral mastectomies related to diagnosis in which rounded ages were used the remaining carriers were censored at the age of last observation this was defined either by the agedate at interview or age at followup depending on the information provided by the participating center carriers censored at diagnosis of breast cancer were considered cases in the analysis mutation carriers censored at ovarian cancer diagnosis were considered unaffected carriers with a censoringlast followup age older than age eighty were censored at age eighty because there are no reliable cancer incidence rates for brca12 carriers beyond age eighty point
 
analyses based on 1703 brca2 mutation carriers and 592163 snps were performed within a survival analysis framework since the mutation carriers were not selected at random with respect to their disease status standard methods of survival eg cox regression may lead to biased estimates of relative risk 30 therefore analyses were conducted by modeling the retrospective likelihood of the observed genotypes conditional on the disease phenotypes the associations between genotype and breast cancer risk at both stages were assessed using the 1degree of freedom score test statistic based on this retrospective likelihood as previously described 9 18 all models were stratified by country of study and 6174delt c5946delt mutation status the most common brca2 mutation in this study and a marker of the ashkenazi jewish population among ashkenazi jewish women 3133 since the linkage disequilibrium structure among ashkenazi jewish people may differ from other mutation carriers 34 stratifying by the 6174delt provides additional control for population stratification to allow for the nonindependence among related individuals an adjusted version of the score test was used in which the variance of the score was derived by taking into account the correlation between the genotypes 35 36 analyses were performed in r using the genabel libraries 37 and custom written software
 
to estimate the magnitude of the associations the effect of each snp was modelled either as a per allele hazard ratio hr ie multiplicative model or as separate hrs for heterozygotes and homozygotes and these were estimated on the log scale the hrs were assumed to be independent of age ie we used a cox proportionalhazards model for the most significant novel associations this assumption was verified by adding a genotypebyage interaction term to the model to fit models in which the hr changed with age the retrospective likelihood was implemented in the pedigreeanalysis software mendel 38 as previously described 9 all analyses were stratified by country of residence and 6174delt c5946delt mutation status and used calendaryear and cohortspecific breast cancer incidence rates for brca2 25 the combined stage one and stage two analyses were also stratified by stage parameter estimates were obtained by maximising the retrospective likelihood to allow for the nonindependence among related mutation carriers we used a robust variance estimation approach in order to obtain standard errors for the parameters 39 40 related individuals were identified through a unique family identifier
 
we also examined the association of both highfrequency and lowfrequency copy number variants cnv to the age of diagnosis of breast cancer as a dichotomous trait using the stage one data 29 we called known common variants copy number polymorphisms cnps with canary 29 cnp alleles lower than 1 in frequency were removed to maximize the number of the cnps that were biallelic instead of multialleleic cnps were removed that had for call rate 95 differential missingness by genotype p103 or departure from hardyweinberg proportions p103 postqc we had one hundred and ninetyone highquality genotyped polymorphisms we used plink to assess association using logistic regression and the same ancestry covariates of no interest as with snps we similarly assessed less common cnvs discovered by birdseye 29 for association with age at diagnosis using plink 41 finally we also looked specifically at cnvs overlapping the brca2 gene itself using lod scores and birdseye
 
we looked for evidence of excess sharing across the genome and the brca2 region using germline 23 shared segments of greater than five cm were computed based on the imputed genotype dataset among both ashkenazi n  304 and nonjewish n  1331 samples compared to samples from an autism study n  808 figure s3 examining sites across the genome every two point five cm excluding telomere and centromere regions we computed the mean of the proportion standard deviation and the maximum values for nonjewish and ashkenazi women respectively
 
we tested whether fiftynine genes known to regulate or interact with brca2 16 table s1 were enriched for associations with age of onset of breast cancer in brca2 mutation carriers using a new implementation of gene set enrichment analysis gsea called metaanalysis geneset enrichment of variant associations magenta 14 the fiftynine genes were compiled using a pubmed abstract mining software chilibot 42 and were selected if they were related to the fanconi anemia pathway 15 as well as others reported from literature to regulate or interact with brca12 43 an association pvalue was calculated for each gene in the genome defined as the mostsignificant association pvalue of all genotyped snps that lie within one hundred and ten kb upstream and forty kb downstream to the genes most extreme transcript boundaries followed by correction for gene score confounders gene size number of snps per gene and linkage disequilibrium related properties snp association pvalues were taken from the stage one gwas to compute a gsea pvalue for the brca gene set the fraction of genes with an association pvalue more significant than the ninetyfive percentile of all gene pvalues in the genome was compared to a null distribution generated by randomly sampling genesets of identical size from the genome 10000 times of the fiftynine brca interactors two genes were assigned the same most significant snp due to physical proximity in the genome to prevent potential overestimation of gene set enrichment due to physical clustering of genes in a gene set we retained only one gene of each subset of genes assigned the same best snp the gene with the most significant gene pvalue for the analysis of both the real and permuted gene sets

each cohort secured approval from their respective institutional review boards and all participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of helsinki
 
the charge consortium included large prospective communitybased cohort studies that have genomewide marker data and extensive data on multiple phenotypes 21 all participating studies approved guidelines for collaboration and a working group arrived at a consensus on phenotype harmonization covariate selection and analytic plans for withinstudy analyses and metaanalyses of results
 
details of cohort selection risk factor assessment and retinal vascular caliber measurements in the four studies have been described in text s1 section one 11 2225 the ages is a prospective study with subject recruitment from 20022006 of 5764 surviving members aged sixtysix years and older of the established reykjavik study a cohort of 19381 participants assembled in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven to study cardiovascular disease and its risk factors among those born between one thousand nine hundred and seven and one thousand nine hundred and thirtyfive 22 the aric study enrolled 15792 men and women including 11478 nonhispanic whites from four us communities to investigate the etiology and sequelae of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors 23 participants were between age fortyfive and sixtyfour years at their baseline examination in 19871989 the chs enrolled 5888 adults sixtyfive years and older from four field centers to study coronary artery disease and stroke the baseline examination took place either in 198990 or 199293 24 the rotterdam study enrolled 7983 inhabitants from a district of rotterdam aged fiftyfive years and older to study cardiovascular neurological ophthalmic and endocrine diseases the baseline examination was in 199093 25
 
the ages and rotterdam cohorts consisted predominantly of caucasian whites only nonhispanic white participants were included from the aric and chs retinal photographs were obtained from participants at the third examination in aric and the tenth in chs participants were excluded if their photographs could not be graded due to cataract corneal opacities or poor focus or if genotyping data were unavailable table 1
 
retinal vascular caliber was measured using standardized protocols and software that were developed initially at the university of wisconsin and used in the aric study and the chs and following slight modifications also in the rotterdam and ages studies text s1 section 2 4 5 9 11  in brief participants underwent retinal photography and optic disccentered images were used to measure vascular caliber pharmacological mydriasis was used in the ages and rotterdam studies for aric chs and rotterdam the photographs of one eye were digitized using a highresolution scanner and for the ages study photographs of both eyes were captured digitally all digital retinal images were analyzed with a semiautomated retinal vessel measurement system and the calibers of all retinal arterioles and venules were measured in an area between half and one discdiameter from the optic disc margin the parrhubbardknudtson formulae were used to compute summary measures for retinal arteriolar and venular calibers in micrometers m and referred to as the central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalents 44 quality control qc measures for intergrader and intragrader intraclass correlation coefficients for retinal vascular calibers for each of the cohorts ranged from 076099 in ages 069089 in aric 067091 in chs to 067095 in the rotterdam study 4 
 
the consortium was formed after the individual studies had finalized their gwas platform selection the four studies included used different platforms the affymetrix genechip snp array six point zero for the aric study illumina humancnv370duo for the ages study and the chs and the illumina infinium humanhap550chip v30 for the rotterdam study all studies used their genotype data to impute to the two point two million nonmonomorphic autosomal snps identified in hapmap ceu population extensive qc analyses were performed in each cohort text s1 sections three and 4 21
 
based on an a priori analysis plan each study fitted an additive genetic model with a 1degree of freedom trend test relating the retinal arteriolar or venular caliber to genotype dosage 02 copies of the minor allele for each snp adjusting for age and sex for the chs and aric studies the analyses were additionally adjusted for study site we used linear regression models to calculate regression coefficients beta and their standard errors se using the probabel program  in ages aric and rotterdam study and the r software in chs  genomic control correction was applied in each study prior to the metaanalysis to implement genomic control the gc value was used to correct the se as follows secorrected  segc all four cohorts showed low dispersion with inflation factors in the range of 10301071
 
we conducted a metaanalysis of the beta estimates obtained from the linear regression models from the four cohorts using an inversevariance weighting using the r software metabel text s1 section 5 45 strand information was available from all cohorts facilitating the metaanalysis after qc filtering and imputation within each study we restricted our metaanalysis to the 2194468 autosomal snps that were common to all cohorts we decided a priori on a genomewide significance threshold of p50108 which corresponds to a pvalue of zero point zero five with bonferroni correction for one million independent tests for two point two million tests it corresponds to an expectation of only zero point one one false positives regardless of testdependence 46 use of this threshold is also supported by ld patterns observed in deep sequencing work within european populations 47
 
the genomewide significant snps for each locus from the discovery phase were examined in four replication cohorts the four replication sample sets included 1709 participants from the australian twins study 1132 from the uk twins study 2501 from the bdes and 1310 from the bmes retinal vascular caliber measurements used the same methodology and formulas as in the charge cohorts details of this and the procedures for genotyping are described in the text s1 sections one and two point in brief in the australian twins study genotyping was performed on the illumina human hap610w quad array in the uk twins study 56 of the participants were genotyped using the illumina 317k humanhap duo array whereas the remaining 44 using the illumina humanhap610quad array in the bdes snps were genotyped using taqman snp genotyping assays applied biosystems ca finally in the bmes genotyping was performed using the illumina 610k array
 
in order to examine the association between snps that were successfully replicated in the current study and cardiovascular diseases we obtained association statistics for each of these snps from several gwa studies we obtained these data from the wtccc on two thousand cases with coronary artery disease and three thousand controls 3 from hvh study on five hundred and one cases with stroke 28 1172 cases with myocardial infarction and 1314 controls 29 from global bpgen on 8871 cases with hypertension and 9027 controls 30 and from diagram on 8130 cases with diabetes mellitus and 38987 controls 31 details of each these studies have been described in the text s1 section six point

parasite dna was obtained either from infected host tissues or parasite isolates maintained in tissue culture as described previously 25 samples were analyzed using a typing scheme that included the surface antigen markers snsag1 snsag3 snsag4 snsag5 snsag6 25 and nine microsatellite markers sn2sn5 and sn7sn11 originally described by asmundsson and rosenthal 85 but applied as modified in wendte et al 25 and rejmanek et al 23 three additional microsatellite markers were designed by the following method publically available sarcocystis neurona expressed sequence tags ests were downloaded from the ncbi dbest database  and the s neurona gene index maintained by the computational biology and functional genomics laboratory at the dana farber cancer institute  databases the downloaded ests were assembled into contigs using the seqman lasergene application contig sequences were then processed with the misa microsatellite identification program  with the following repeat parameters definition unit sizeminimum repeats 212 37 45 54 63 73 82 92 102 112 122 132 142 152 interruptions maximum difference between two simple sequence repeats twentyfive point

for this study s neurona dna from fifteen sea otters and four harbor seals was analyzed additionally samples from twentyone sea otters two harbor seals three horses and two raccoons previously described by wendte et al 25 at the snsag antigen loci and ms sn9 were further typed in this study at the remaining ten ms loci finally s neurona dna from twentyone sea otters one porpoise four horses thirteen opossums and one cat that was previously typed by rejmanek et al 23 at snsag3 snsag4 and ms markers sn2sn5 and sn7sn11 were combined with the data in this study for a total sample set that included eightyseven samples from fiftyseven sea otters six harbor seals two raccoons thirteen opossums seven horses one porpoise and one cat in all seventyfive of the eightyseven samples were from california other states represented include georgia n  two samples illinois n  1 missouri n  3 washington n  4 and wisconsin n  2 some overlap existed between the samples typed in this study and those reported by rejmanek et al samples so4387 so4413 h1 h2 and h3 in this study are reported as so1 so2 horse 1 horse 2 and horse three in rejmanek et al 23 respectively complete information about the sample origins is found in table s1
 
toxoplasma gondii isolates from a water cistern n  2 chickens n  11 and one cat associated with a human waterborne toxoplasmosis outbreak 44 as well as laboratory strain cep were typed at microsatellite loci b17 b18 tgma tub2 w35 39 and m95 40 markers were pcr amplified and sequenced to assign alleles as for s neurona markers 25 representatives of each microsatellite allele at each locus were placed in genbank under accession numbers b17 hm85126067 tgma hm85126873 w35 hm85127477 m95 hm85127881
 
because different parts of the genome are likely under different selective pressures all s neurona samples were categorized by an antigen ag type designated by roman numerals and a microsatellite ms type indicated by a lowercase letter designation ag types were defined by the presenceabsence of mutually exclusive antigen genes snsag1 snsag5 or snsag6 and the inheritance pattern of alleles at snsag3 and snsag4 23 25 ms types were assigned on the basis of allele combinations defined by the number of di or tri nucleotide repeats at each locus sn2sn5 and sn7sn11 sn1520 sn1863 sn515 was a complex repeat in which each isolate possessed one of two alleles samples from the study by rejmanek et al 23 were not typed at the snsag156 loci but were placed into ag groups based on the allelic profile at snsag3 and snsag4 and by the ag group their ms type was associated with in samples typed at all markers for example based on the alleles at snsag3 and snsag4 sample so4 table s1 could be placed either in ag type ii or v but its ms type was only found associated with ag type ii in samples where all markers were typed making this the most likely though not definitive ag type designation the s neurona strains assessed by rejmanek et al 23 were also not typed at ms markers sn1520 sn1863 and sn515 presumptively classifying these samples into ms types based on alleles at sn2sn5 and sn7sn11 is likely accurate though since these three markers did not provide additional resolution to ms types for the fortysix additional s neurona strains described in this study
 
the alleles present at ms markers sn2sn5 and sn7sn11 were used for creation of a multilocus sequence typing scheme by which all isolates could be compared the numerical designation of alleles allowed the detection of which ms types formed clonal complexes using the eburst program 48 default settings were used which grouped ms types on the basis of sharing alleles at eight of the nine markers analyzed
 
to assess t gondii isolates for clonality ms alleles were combined with previously published dna sequence analysis at three genetic loci pcrrflp or dna sequencing at ten loci and serologic analysis as described by vaudaux et al 44
 
statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism five and 2 values were considered significant at p  005

seven study samples contributed to this metaanalysis of gwa studies on serum dheas concentrations comprising a total of 14846 men and women of caucasian origin the consortium was made up of populations from twinsuk n  4906 framingham heart study fhs n  3183 ship n  1832 rotterdam study rs1 n  1597 inchianti n  1182 health abc n  1222 and good n  924 full details can be found in text s1
 
blood samples were collected from each of the study participants either after overnight fasting or nonfasting and the serum levels of dheas were measured by either immunoassay or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lcmsms methods text s1 because the distribution of the serum dheas levels was skewed we log transformed the concentrations and the transformed data used in the subsequent analysis
 
seven study populations were genotyped using a variety of genotyping platforms including illumina humanhap 317k 550k 610k 1mduo beadchip and affymetrix array 500k 60 each cohort followed a strict quality control on the genotyping data more details on the quality control and filtering criteria can be found in text s1 in order to increase genomic coverage and allow the evaluation of the same snps across as many study populations as possible each study imputed genotype data based on the hapmap ceu build thirtysix point algorithms were used to infer unobserved genotypes in a probabilistic manner in either mach  or impute 61 we exclude nongenotyped snps with an imputation quality score 02 and snps with allele frequency 001 from metaanalysis
 
each study performed genomewide association testing for serum concentrations of dheas across approximately two point five million snps under an additive genetic model separately in men and women text s1 the analyses were adjusted for age in addition the association testing was performed in the combined men and women data with adjustment for age and sex studies used plink genabel snptest quicktest or merlin for the association testing the summary results from each cohort were metaanalyzed by zscore pooling method implemented in metal  we chose this method to minimize the impact of the different assays used for serum dheas measurements specifically for each study we converted the twosided p value after adjustment for population stratification by the genomic control method to a z statistic that was signed to reflect the direction of the association given the reference allele each z score was then weighted the squared weights were chosen to sum to 1 and each samplespecific weight was proportional to the square root of the effective number of individuals in the sample we summed the weighted z statistics across studies and converted the summary z score to a twosided p value we also used i2 index to assess betweenstudy heterogeneity and the inverse variance weighted method to estimate the effect size genomewide significance was defined as p5108 the association between the dheasassociated snps and the related gene expression levels in muther data were examined by mixed linear regression modelling which takes both family structure and batch effects into account the significance was defined as p0006 after accounting for multiple testing bonferroni method correcting nine independent tests

the scale study is a populationbased study of the etiology of nhl carried out in all of denmark and sweden during one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine to two thousand and two 26 nhl subtype diagnoses were reviewed and reclassified according to the world health organization who classification 1 as previously described 26 for this gwas scale1 we used dna from four hundred cases with follicular lymphoma fl one hundred and fifty from denmark and two hundred and fifty from sweden and from one hundred and fifty danish controls individually matched to the danish fl cases by sex and age at study inclusion we also used material collected from six hundred and seventythree control subjects in a separate swedish populationbased casecontrol study of rheumatoid arthritis the eira study 21 27 the latter was conducted during one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix to two thousand and five among residents eighteen to seventy years of age in the southern and central parts of sweden including 90 of swedish residents hence the population controls recruited in this study were considered to represent the same study population as the swedish component of the scale study with regard to genetic variation genotyping completion rates were similar between cases and controls out of four hundred cases and eight hundred and twentythree controls genotyped three hundred and seventynine cases 95 and seven hundred and ninetyone controls 96 were included in the final analysis study subjects used in stages 2 three and validation in other nhl subtypes table 1 table s1 s2 have been previously described 6 812 and details are available as supporting text text s1 for the scale2 nhl subtype validation study we used the rest of the lymphoma cases with blood samples originally recruited in scale n  1869 danish control subjects not included in the gwas n  556 a second set of control subjects from the eira study n  742 and a third group of controls recruited in a national populationbased casecontrol study of breast cancer the cancer and hormones replacement in sweden cahres study 28 n  720 the control subjects from this study were randomly selected from the swedish general population to match the expected age distribution of the participating breast cancer cases 50 to seventyfour years
 
stage i genotyping of 317503 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps was done on the humanhap300 version 10 array validation genotyping was done using sequenom iplex snps in the human leukocyte antigen hla region that failed primer design for sequenom assays were genotyped using taqman applied biosystems
 
the scan included 317503 snps from the humanhap300 version 10 array the datasets were filtered on the basis of snp genotyping call rates 95 completeness sample completion rate 90 minor allele frequency maf all subjects as well as cases and controls separately 003 and nondeviation from hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe p106 we also excluded snps with cluster plot problems and those on the x and y chromosomes study subjects with gender discrepancies andor labelling errors were removed we also removed individual samples with evidence of cryptic family relationships identified using thegenome command in plink to detect outliers in terms of population stratification we performed principal component pc analysis using the eigenstrat software figure s4 a subset of linkage disequilibrium ld thinned snps was selected such that all pairwise associations had r202 and longrange regions of high ld reported to potentially confound genome scans were removed 29 twentyfive samples were removed as population outliers on the basis of their values on the first three pcs to adjust for possible stratification in our association analyses we adjusted the regression analyses using the first three pcs the number of pcs used for adjustment was determined by plotting the eigenvalues and locating the position of the elbow on the scree plot figure s5 wald tests treating minor allele counts as continuous covariates were used to test for association the genomic inflation factor  was calculated to be one point zero two eight three after adjusting for the first three pcs suggesting the presence of minimal stratification quantilequantile plots for the associations before and after adjustment are shown in figure s6 finally we assessed associations of age and sex with main genotypes among the control subjects to address the possibility of confounding by these factors table s11 as there was no evidence of associations of age or sex with genotypes among the controls we did not adjust for them in the final main effects analyses of genotypes
 
in stage 2 similar quality control measures were applied as in stage 1 including genotyping call rate 95 sample completion rate 90 and maf 005 we tested each validation study for association using trend tests for metaanalyses across studies and nhl subtypes we used the cochranmantelhaenszel method to calculate the combined odds ratio and pvalue and 2 tests for heterogeneity multivariate logistic regression was used to test for independence of snp effects for validation among other nhl subtypes the control subjects were the same as those in stages two and three for validation in fl for all studies except scale2 only europeanancestry subjects were included and the possibility of population stratification affecting the results has been thoroughly explored and found to be low in earlier investigations in the same populations 6 8
 
we used imputev1 for the imputation of snps from the one thousand genomes pilot1 ceu data august two thousand and nine release and the hapmap phase ii release twentytwo ceu data we set a strict threshold for imputation using only snps with confidence scores of 09 call rates 90 nondeviation from hardyweinberg equilibrium p 0001 and maf 001 the imputation was done on the stage one samples separately for each of the two reference datasets and snps showing a discordance of 5 between the genotypes imputed with the two datasets were excluded from further analysis the data were then merged using hapmap ii as the master dataset to which additional imputed snps from the one thousand genomes dataset were added hla alleles were imputed by identifying tag snps 15 from the genotyped and imputed snp dataset we used plink for haplotype imputation with the tag snps and downstream association analyses only haplotypes with call rates 90 maf1 and probability thresholds 08 were analyzed
 
for coalescence analysis all twelve snps genotyped in this study and within a region of 177 kb adjacent to the two snps associated with the fl risk were used to construct haplotypes these were phased using the phase program 30 and tested for association using plink the ancestral haplotype was constructed from the chimpanzee pantro2 allele whenever possible and otherwise from the macaque alleles an ancestral recombination graph was constructed using the program beagle 13 31 which allows recombination assuming an infinite site mutation model after identifying the first recombination event the haplotype segment before the recombination spot was used to construct a median joining network using the network program 14 the alleles of the imputed snp rs9378212 were then phased on each haplotype segment using the phase program

the care project has been approved by the committee on the use of humans as experimental subjects couhes of the massachusetts institute of technology and by the institutional review boards of each of the nine parent cohorts
 
affymetrix six point zero genotyping and qc filtering of africanamerican samples from the care cardiovascular consortium was performed as described previously 25 after qc filtering for each of aric cardia cfs jhs and mesa cohorts and subsequent merging 8367 samples and 770390 snps remained to limit relatedness among samples we restricted all analyses to a subset of 6209 samples in which all pairs have genomewide relatedness of zero point one zero or less inferred using the smartrel program in eigensoft 30 see web resources we merged care genotype data with genotype data from the hapmap3 project 18 hapmap3 samples had been genotyped on both affymetrix six point zero and illumina 1m chips we excluded snps that did not pass qc in hapmap3 as well as at and cg snps to avoid allele complementarity issues leaving 556698 snps for further analysis we note that hapmix accuracy is insensitive to the number of snps if at least 250000 snps are used 23
 
when run in default mode hapmix outputs local ancestry estimates as the expected probability of 0 one or two copies of european ancestry at each snp see ref 23 and web resources however hapmix can also be run in a mode that outputs the inferred joint distribution of local ancestry and allele value so as to resolve the hethet case both genotype and local ancestry heterozygous in order to obtain integer estimates of local ancestry one approach is to simply round the probabilities which however can lead to biased estimates in regions with limited snp coverage we chose an alternative approach that does not produce these types of biases sampling from the probabilities for 0 one or two european chromosomes at each position results in this mode are highly concordant with the default mode producing correlations of 100 in genomewide ancestry and 988 in local ancestry
 
we selected a random subset of 100000 autosomal snps for each snp we simulated phenotypes for r  one point zero null model and r  121520 causal models for the null model we chose random subsets of 1000 cases and 1000 controls for causal models we chose a random subset of 1000 controls and then chose 1000 cases from the remaining samples so that samples with 012 reference alleles have relative probabilities 1rr two of being chosen
 
a 21dof statistic via the armitage trend test with adjustment for genomewide ancestry as described previously 50 genomewide ancestry was inferred as the genomewide average of local ancestry estimates from hapmix 23 we note that this is 99 correlated to the top eigenvector of a principal components analysis run using ceu and yri from hapmap3 to compute principal components 18 20
 
a 21dof likelihood ratio test that compares the null hypothesis of casecontrol odds ratio r  one with the alternate hypothesis of r 1 where r is assumed to be the same across populations while the allele frequencies are treated as nuisance parameters
 
for every local ancestry x one x two aa ae or ee and phenotype y 1 for cases zero for controls let   denote the counts of individuals with genotypes 2 one or zero point then the snp1 likelihood is defined aswhere  represent the allele frequencies in cases  represent allele frequencies in controls and r is the allelic odds ratio
 
then the 2 statistic with one degree of freedom is
 
a 21dof likelihood ratio test that compares the local ancestry in the disease cases to the average local ancestry across the genome in the same disease cases this is more powerful than comparing cases to controls since no statistical noise is introduced from controls 7 however it is critical when using this approach to infer local ancestry using a method that has been shown not to produce artifactual deviations in average local ancestry in large data sets of controls from the admixed population 23
 
let i be the genomewide ancestry of individual i and let ni be the number of european chromosomes in individual i at the candidate snp restricting to disease cases only we define the likelihood as function of ancestry odds ratio  where  is the multiplicative risk for disease given one or two european alleles it follows that the likelihood for 2 1 or zero european alleles at individual i is
 

 
then the likelihood is  with the a 21dof likelihood ratio test defined as
 
a 22dof that sums the snp1 and the adm statistics 25 we note that since snp1 conditions out the local ancestry and the adm statistic employs only the local ancestry these two tests contain independent information
 
a 21dof test that combines the snp1 and adm likelihood functions by using the implied ancestry odds ratio under the assumption of a single causal variant with same odds ratio r across the european and african populations
 
the mix likelihood is defined as the product of the likelihoods for snp1 and adm as  where is the relative increase in risk per extra european allele under the assumption of single causal variant with odds ratio r it follows that is a function of the snp odds ratio r and the population allele frequencies in controls  we then compute a 2 statistic with one degree of freedom as
 
a 21dof test that compares the alternate hypothesis of different odds ratios in different ancestries with the null model that assumes the same odds ratio the likelihood extends the snp1 likelihood by allowing ancestry specific odds ratios ra and re which leads to and  we then compute a 21dof statistic as
 
we incorporate the observed variance of the average local ancestry across the genome assuming that the average local ancestry at each snp is normally distributed with mean and standard deviation  where is the ancestry odds ratio we estimate empirically and set  where is the empirical mean across the genome of the per snp average local ancestry estimates then the admixture likelihood becomes  we can then compute a 21dof statistic admgc that incorporates the empirical variance and in the adm score asin a similar manner we can replace with in the admixture component of the mix likelihood to compute a new 21dof statistic mixgc that incorporates the empirical variance of the average local ancestry
 
many of the likelihoods defined above require a multidimensional optimization the number of parameters optimized in the likelihoods is three for the snp1 score one for the adm score three for the mix score and four for the het score the het score can be reduced to two independent 2parameter optimizations by considering cases and controls separately for the adm score newtons method was used for the snp1 mix and het scores brents algorithm was used gsl software library implementation see web resources the maximization is performed in one dimension over each parameter in turn repeating for each parameter until the algorithm converges in rare instances extreme variation in the slope of the log likelihood as a function of odds ratio can cause the algorithm to not converge in this situations a simple binary search is used
 
we employed the widely used mach 51 imputation method to infer genotypes at untyped snps in the care african american samples as reference haplotypes we used either the cosmopolitan approach of providing all the ceu and yri haplotypes from hapmap phase three data 18 or a local ancestry aware approach in which for every locus in every sample we provided either yri ceuyri ceu reference haplotypes to mach according to the number of copies of yri 210 inferred by hapmix we note that the local ancestry aware approach has been previously shown to boost imputation accuracy in admixed populations 24 35 for both strategies we ran mach in two steps first by training the model parameters on a random sample of two hundred individuals with the rounds parameter set to fifty followed by imputation of all the samples using the trained model from step one point importantly we note that the local ancestry aware approach can be applied as an addon to any imputation method
 
even when the true odds ratio is the same across populations different imputation quality across the segments with different ancestries can lead to different estimates for the allelic odds ratios in european versus african segments we account for this by adjusting the observed allelic odds ratios in the snp1 and the mix scores as follows following a derivation similar to 52 see text s1 we show that the expected observed odds ratio at an imputed causal snp with true odds ratio r is a function of r the imputation accuracy as measured by the correlation between true and imputed snp and the allele frequency unfortunately we do not know the true genotypes and thus cannot compute the correlation between the true and imputed genotypes however reliable estimates for this correlation have been proposed here we chose to use mach estimates shown to produce robust estimates of imputation quality 53 to estimate ancestryspecific imputation error rates we restrict the computation to segments containing both alleles from that ancestry given that imputation accuracies are estimated directly from the data depend on the term r and the allele frequencies then the likelihood term from the mix admixture association score becomes  as in the previous version of the score the optimization is done over the three free terms and  snp1 score is updated in a similar fashion
 
we randomly selected 100000 autosomal snps and simulated phenotypes as described above using r  15 for all the compared scores we computed the maximum statistic over all snp across a region centered on the snp of interest taking the twenty snps upstream and twenty snps downstream we computed the maximum of the statistics either over fortyone snps by including the simulated causal snp or over forty snps by ignoring the statistics at the simulated causal snp
 
casecontrol phenotypes for coronary heart disease chd and type two diabetes t2d were ascertained as described previously 25 in each case phenotypes were available for only a subset of the five care cohorts restricting to 6209 unrelated individuals as defined above we analyzed nine hundred and twentynine cases and 4150 controls for t2d and one hundred and seventynine cases and 3328 controls for chd for every analyzed snp we performed imputation within a region of 10mb centered on the snp of interest using the mach imputation method under the local ancestry aware framework we assessed the scoring statistics at all snps within 100kb of the snps of interest
 
the fgfr2 locus has been associated with breast cancer in women of european and asian descent 36 and further fine mapping in africanamerican women has identified snp rs2981578 as showing the highest signal of association 36 37 we analyzed data from a gwas including 5761 unrelated africanamerican women from eleven epidemiological studies the multiethnic cohort study mec 54 the los angeles component of the womens contraceptive and reproductive experiences care cohort 55 the womens circle of health study wchs 56 the san francisco bay area breast cancer study sfbc 57 the northern california breast cancer family registry ncbcfr 58 59 the carolina breast cancer study cbcs 60 the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial plco 61 the nashville breast health study nbhs62 the wake forest university breast cancer study wfbc 63 informed consent was obtained from all subjects detailed information about the design and organization of each study will be provided elsewhere c haiman and colleagues unpublished data genotyping was conducted using the illumina human1mduo beadchip a total of 1043036 snps were kept after qc filtering imputation was performed using the mach software providing as reference all the haplotypes of ceu and yri hapmap phase two panels we focused our analysis on all the typed or imputed snps two hundred and fiftyone in total located 100kb upstream and downstream of snp rs2981578
 
for each of 100000 autosomal snps we simulated phenotypes for   zero null model and   005010020 causal model using a random subset of 2000 samples for the null model phenotypes were sampled from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance one point for the causal model the mean was shifted to 02 for 012 reference alleles in each case we subtracted out the overall phenotypic mean

the institutional review board at the university of southern california approved the study protocol
 
nine studies were genotyped as part of the gwas of prostate cancer in african american men below is a brief description of each study
 
the mec includes 215251 men and women aged 4575 years at recruitment from hawaii and california 32 the cohort was assembled in 19931996 by mailing a selfadministered 26page questionnaire to persons identified primarily through the drivers license files identification of incident cancer cases is by regular linkage with the hawaii tumor registry and the los angeles county cancer surveillance program both ncifunded surveillance epidemiology and end results registries from the cancer registries information is obtained about stage and grade collection of biospecimens from incident prostate cases began in california in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive and in hawaii in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven and a biorepository was established between two thousand and one and two thousand and six from 67000 mec participants the participation rates for providing a blood sample have been greater than 60 through january 1 two thousand and eight the african american casecontrol study in the mec included 1094 cases and 1096 controls
 
the sccs is a prospective cohort of african and nonafrican americans which during 20022009 enrolled approximately 86000 residents aged 4079 years across twelve southern states 33 recruitment occurred mainly at community health centers institutions providing basic health services primarily to the medically uninsured so that the cohort includes many adults of lower income and educational status each study participant completed a detailed baseline questionnaire and nearly 90 provided a biologic specimen approximately 45 a blood sample and 45 buccal cells followup of the cohort is conducted by linkage to national mortality registers and to state cancer registries included in this study are two hundred and twelve incident african american prostate cancer cases and a matched stratified random sample of four hundred and nineteen african american male cohort members without prostate cancer at the index date selected by incidence density sampling
 
the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial 34 is a randomized twoarm trial among men and women aged 5574 years to determine if screening reduced the mortality from these cancers male participants randomized to the intervention arm underwent prostate specific antigen psa screening at baseline and annually for five years and digital rectal examination at baseline and annually for three years sequential blood samples were collected from participants assigned to the screening arm participation was 93 at the baseline blood draw 19932001 buccal cell samples were collected from participants in the control arm of the trial participation was about 85 for this component included in this study are two hundred and eightysix african american prostate cancer cases and two hundred and sixtynine controls without a history of prostate cancer matched on age at randomization and study year of the trial
 
the cpsii nutrition cohort includes over 86000 men and 97000 women from twentyone us states who completed a mailed questionnaire in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo aged 4092 years at baseline 35 starting in 1997 followup questionnaires were sent to surviving cohort members every other year to update exposure information and to ascertain occurrence of new cases of cancer a 90 response rate has been achieved for each followup questionnaire from 19982001 blood samples were collected in a subgroup of 39376 cohort members to further supplement the dna resources during 20002001 buccal cell samples were collected by mail from an additional 70000 cohort members incident cancers are verified through medical records or through state cancer registries or death certificates when the medical record can not be obtained genomic dna from seventysix african american prostate cancer cases and one hundred and fiftytwo agematched controls were included in stage one of the scan
 
participants in this study were identified from epidemiological prostate cancer studies conducted at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in the houston metropolitan area since one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix point cases were accrued from six institutions in the houston medical center and were not restricted with respect to gleason score stage or psa controls were identified via randomdigitdialing or among hospital visitors and they were frequency matched to cases on age and race lifestyle demographic and family history data were collected using a standardized questionnaire these studies contributed five hundred and fortythree african american cases and four hundred and seventyfour controls to this study 36
 
cases in this study were patients 1 undergoing treatment for prostate cancer in the department of urology at johns hopkins hospital from one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine to 2007 2 undergoing treatment at the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center from two thousand and three to 2007 and 3 outside referrals as part of the hereditary prostate cancer study from one thousand nine hundred and ninety to present blood was obtained from groups 2 and 3 while dna from normal tissue was obtained from group 1 data are available on age at diagnosis race pretreatment prostatespecific antigen psa values clinical pathology values and family history the control subjects were men undergoing disease screening and were not thought to have prostate cancer on the basis of a physical exam and a serum psa value below four ngml screenings were performed at the johns hopkins applied physics lab at bethlehem steel in baltimore and at local african american churches in east baltimore 7 a total of three hundred and sixtyeight african american cases and one hundred and seventytwo controls contributed to stage one point
 
the laapc is a populationbased casecontrol study of aggressive prostate among african americans in los angeles county 37 cases were identified through the los angeles county cancer surveillance program rapid case ascertainment system and eligible cases included african american men diagnosed with a first primary prostate cancer between january 1 one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine and december 31 two thousand and three point eligible cases also had either tumor extension outside the prostate metastatic prostate cancer in sites other than prostate or needle biopsy of the prostate with gleason grade eight or higher or gleason grade seven and tumor in more than 23 of the biopsy cores controls were identified by a neighborhood walk algorithm and were men never diagnosed with prostate cancer and were frequency matched to cases on age 5 years for this study genomic dna was included for two hundred and ninetysix cases and one hundred and forty controls we also included an additional one hundred and sixtythree african american controls from the mec that were frequency matched to cases on age
 
the african american component of this study population comprised one hundred and sixty men seventyfive cases diagnosed with more aggressive prostate cancer and eightyfive agematched controls 38 all subjects were recruited and frequencymatched on the major medical institutions in cleveland ohio ie the cleveland clinic university hospitals of cleveland and their affiliates between two thousand and one and two thousand and four point the cases were newly diagnosed with histologically confirmed disease gleason score 7 tumor stage t2c or a prostatespecific antigen level 10 ngml at diagnosis controls were men without a prostate cancer diagnosis who underwent standard annual medical examinations at the collaborating medical institutions
 
unrelated men selfdescribed as african american were recruited for several casecontrol studies on genetic risk factors for prostate cancer between the years two thousand and one and two thousand and five from the division of urology at howard university hospital huh in washington dc control subjects unrelated to the cases and matched for age 5 years were also ascertained from the prostate cancer screening population of the division of urology at huh 24 these studies included two hundred and ninetytwo cases and three hundred and fiftynine controls
 
the study population consists of participants from one of two populationbased casecontrol studies among residents of king county washington 39 40 incident caucasian and african american cases with histologically confirmed prostate cancer were ascertained from the seattlepuget sound seer cancer registry during two time periods 19931996 and 20022005 agematched 5year age groups controls were men without a selfreported history of being diagnosed with prostate cancer and were identified using onestep random digit telephone dialing controls were ascertained during the same time periods as the cases a total of one hundred and fortyfive incident african american cases and eightyone african american controls were included from these studies
 
the henry ford health system hfhs recruited cases diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate of caucasian or african american race less than seventyfive years of age and living in the metropolitan detroit tricounty area 41 controls were randomly selected from the same hfhs population base from which cases were drawn the control sample was frequency matched at a ratio of three enrolled cases to one control based on race and fiveyear age stratum in total six hundred and thirtyseven cases and two hundred and fortyfour controls were enrolled between january two thousand and two and december two thousand and four point of study enrollees dna for two hundred and thirtyfour african americans cases and ninetytwo controls were included in stage one of the scan
 
genotyping of 7123 samples from these studies 3621 cases and 3502 controls was conducted using the illumina infinium one mduo bead array at the university of southern california and the nci genotyping core facility plco study following genotyping samples were removed based on the following exclusion criteria 1 unknown replicates across studies n  24 none within studies 2 call rates 95 n  126 3 samples with 10 mean heterozygosity on the x chromosome andor 10 mean intensity on the y chromosome  we inferred three samples to be xx and six to be xxy 4 ancestry outliers n  108 discussed below and 5 samples that were related n  141 discussed below to assess genotyping reproducibility we included one hundred and fiftyeight replicate samples the average concordance rate was 9999 993 for all pairs starting with 1153397 snps we removed snps with 95 call rate mafs1 or 1 qc mismatch based on sample replicates n  105411 the analysis included 1047986 snps among 3425 cases and 3290 controls
 
we used plink to calculate the probabilities of sharing 0 1 and two alleles z  z0 z1 z2 across all possible pairs of samples to determine individuals who were likely to be related to others within and across studies we identified one hundred and sixtyseven pairs of related subjects mz twin parentoffspring pairs full and halfsibling pairs based on the values of their observed probability vector z being within one sd of the expected values of z for their respective relationship the criterion for removal was such that individuals that were connected with a higher number of pairs were chosen for removal in all other cases one of the two members was randomly selected for removal a total of one hundred and fortyone subjects were removed
 
the eigenstrat software was used to calculate eigenvectors that explained genetic differences in ancestry among samples in the study 42 the program included data from both hapmap phase three populations and our study so that comparisons to reference populations of known ethnicity could be made an individual was subject to filtering from the analysis if his value along eigenvector one or two was outside of four sds of the mean of each respective eigenvector we identified one hundred and eight individuals who met this criterion eigenvector one was highly correlated   0997 p11016 with percentage of european ancestry estimated in hapmix 43 together the top ten eigenvectors used in the analysis explain 21 of the global genetic variability among subjects
 
at each locus and for each participant local ancestry was defined as the estimated number of european chromosomes continuous between 02 carried by the participant estimated via the hapmix program 43 to summarize local ancestry at each region for each individual we averaged across all local ancestry estimates that were within the start and end points of the region table s5 we used this average value as an additional covariate in the risk analyses
 
in order to generate a dataset suitable for finemapping we carried out genomewide imputation using the software mach 44 phased haplotype data from the founders of the ceu ceph and yri yoruba hapmap phase two samples were used to infer ld patterns in order to impute ungenotyped markers the rsq metric defined as the observed variance divided by the expected variance provides a measure of the quality of the imputation at any snp and was used as a threshold in determining which snps to filter from analysis rsq03 of the 1539328 common snps maf005 in the yri population in hapmap phase 2 we could impute 1392294 90 with rsq08 for all imputed snps presented in the results and tables reported herein the average rsq was zero point nine two estimated in mach
 
for each typed and imputed snp odds ratios or and 95 confidence intervals 95 ci were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age at diagnosis or age at the reference date for controls study the first ten eigenvalues and local ancestry for each snp we tested for allele dosage effects through a one df wald chisquare trend test
 
we finemapped each risk locus in search of 1 a better marker of the index signal in african americans and 2 a novel signal that is independent of the index signal these analyses included snps genotyped and imputed spanning two hundred and fifty kb upstream and two hundred and fifty kb downstream of each index signal if the index signal was contained within an ld block based on the d statistic of 250 kb then the region was extended to include the entire region of ld stepwise regression was performed by region to select the most informative risk variants as discussed below in models adjusted for age study global ancestry the 1st eigenvector and local ancestry in the stepwise regression we preserved the original sample size by using the mean genotype of typed subjects in place of nocalls for snps with 100 genotyping completion rate
 
within each known risk locus it is expected that markers that are associated with risk in african americans will be correlated with the index signal reported in europeans thus we identified and tested snps that are correlated r202 with the index signals in europeans in hapmap ceu population because these variants are not independent and there is a high prior probability that signals exist among such variants we applied a lenient criteria for keeping them in the stepwise regression the average number of tags to capture r208 these snps in each region was used as a correction factor as they define the number of independent tests p0004 for all of the remaining markers that were not correlated with the index signal in europeans we applied a more stringent  level for defining statistical significance in each risk region we determined the number of tag snps needed to capture all common alleles maf005 with r208 in the yri population in phase two hapmap using single and multimarker tests an  of 005the total number of tags was applied to assess statistical significance for any putative novel independent signal in each region p56106 for the correlated snps we had 80 power to detect an or of one point one seven per copy for a 20 risk allele whereas for the novel snps the detectable or for such an allele increased to one point two six per copy a similar stepwise analysis was also performed at 8q24 12781290 mb for snps with nominal pvalues005 keeping snps if p0001 in the multivariate model this choice of pvalue reflects a balance between the need to correct for multiple comparisons and the prior knowledge that this region harbors multiple independent risk alleles for prostate cancer for snps in the 8q24 region we had 80 power to detect an or of one point one nine per copy for a 20 risk allele we tested heterogeneity of effect by study for all seventysix snps presented in table one and table two and we observed five significant associations p005 three point six expected and only one at p001 rs7000448 at 8q24 p  0004
 
we modeled the cumulative genetic risk of prostate cancer using the risk variants reported in previous gwas total  40 for regions outside of 8q24 with multiple correlated variants we selected the snp with the largest or in african americans at 8q24 we used the seven variants reported in al olama et al 1 we compared the results to a model of the snps found to be significantly associated with risk in african americans which included the index signals if nominally associated with risk in african americans p005 as well as snps identified from the stepwise procedures at all loci including 8q24 total  27 more specifically in each case we summed the number of risk alleles for each individual and estimated the odds ratio per allele for this aggregate unweighted allele count variable as an approximate risk score appropriate for unlinked variants with independent effects of approximately the same magnitude for each allele for individuals missing genotypes for a given snp we assigned the average number of risk alleles 2 risk allele frequency to replace the missing value for that snp to address the independence assumption we compared the betas for each snp with the betas obtained when all snps were included in the same model we found remarkable consistency in the betas which supports their associations as being independent table s9 we also stratified the risk score analysis by firstdegree family history of prostate cancer we tested for differences in the effect of the risk score by disease severity advanced disease defined as gleason 810 andor nonlocalized stage vs nonadvanced disease defined as gleason7 and localized stage
 
we estimated crudely how much of the familial risk of prostate cancer is explained by the known risk alleles as summarized in the improved risk score in this study a firstdegree family history of prostate cancer is associated with a relative risk of one point five five 95 ci 132181 making the simplifying assumption that all risk alleles are inherited independently then the correlation between the risk allele count for two firstdegree relatives will be equal to zero point five ie will equal 12 the probability of sharing one allele ibdthe probability of sharing two alleles ibd making the further assumption that the number of risk alleles is distributed as approximately normal with mean  thirty point six six and standard deviation three point zero seven alleles in the population estimated among african american controls and that in cases the mean is thirtytwo point one three alleles with roughly the same standard deviation 308 we can approximate the mean number of alleles in individuals of unknown prostate cancer status but each of whom has a single firstdegree relative brother or father with the disease as 306610523213052  3103 since this is just zero point three seven more alleles than is expected in the control population overall we see that the relative odds of prostate cancer for a man with a brother or father with prostate cancer is only explog117037  one point zero six higher than an unselected subject ie one not selected on the basis of disease in a firstdegree relative compared to the approximately 155fold increase in relative risk this risk score may only explain 11 10611551100 of risk in firstdegree relatives of cases which indicates that many more alleles are required to explain familial aggregation in the african american population

during rtg cells lose synchrony and continue to further cell cycles complicating calculation of a cumulative cell division curve we assumed that bud emergence and nuclear division occur with the same relative timing in the first and second cell division after rtg to distinguish between daughter and mother cells we took advantage of the fact that after rtg ndt80 cells produce an elongated bud that can be easily distinguished from the round mother cell figure 1a the fraction of cells that had not yet budded unbudded cells was calculated according to the equation unbudded cells  x1y1z1 where x1  unbudded round cells ie cells before the first mitotic division y1  unbudded elongated cells ie products of the first mitotic division and z1  total cells counted at late times due to continuous division of the cells the number of cells that have already undergone the first mitotic division y1 can exceed the number of cells that have not undergone a mitotic division x1 in such a case x1y1 was set to zero
 
the fraction of cells that had undergone the first nuclear division postdivision was calculated according to the equation postdivision  x2y2 where x2  round cells that were undergoing mitosis detected as budded with a nucleus stretched between the mother and daughter cells plus all elongated cells with a nucleus ie cells that have already completed the first mitotic division and y2  all round cells at late times due to continuous cell division x2 may be greater than y2 in such a case the fraction of postdivision cells was set to one

following our conjecture that snps associated with the genes in a pathway involved in disease will exhibit more withingroup similarity than acrossgroup similarity we propose pathways of distinction analysis poda a method designed to address the following questions
 
given some set of snps do we find that on average cases are closer to other cases than to controls or that controls are closer to other controls than to cases
 
if we look for these distinctions systematically over all snpsets of potential interest can we use it to single out snpsets which may be associated with disease
 
in poda a set of snps are selected and for each sample we compute whether it is closer to the pool of remaining cases or controls across that snp set using the relative distance statistic described below once this is done for every sample the distribution of the relative distance statistic is compared in the cases and controls using a nonparametric statistic addressing the first question above this may be carried out amongst all snp sets of interest adjusting the value for the multiple hypotheses to find snp sets for which cases more strongly resemble the population of remaining cases while controls more strongly resemble the population of remaining controls
 
we begin with a discussion of how we measure the relative distance of an individual to the other cases vs other controls a simple but computationally intensive approach is to represent each sample by a vector in an dimensional space where is the number of snps in the group of interest one can then compute between each sample pair their distance in this dimensional space using a euclidean manhattan or hamming metric for each sample we would define its relative distance statistic as the mean of its distance to other controls minus the mean of its distance to other cases a sample that is more similar to cases will exhibit a positive statistic whereas one that is more similar to other controls will exhibit a negative statistic for the given snp set we would then have for each sample a value quantifying its relative distance that was computed without knowledge of that samples class ie using a leaveoneout scheme and could then be used in further tests by doing this for all pathways of interest one derives a relative distance value for each sample in each pathway
 
this bruteforce approach while conceptually clear has two significant drawbacks the first is that the distance computation is where is the total number of samples in the studya considerable undertaking particularly if many snp sets are to be analyzed and one that becomes exceedingly troublesome in the context of permutation tests the second drawback is that because we are taking the mean of the distances a sample that is situated squarely within a cluster of cases may have a large casedistance value due to the dispersion of cases around it both of these issues are circumvented by instead considering the relative distance to the centroids of the cases and controls in the dimensional space a computation that can be performed in for all samples it is this approach that poda employs as follows
 
in 29 30 the authors consider a measure of individual s distance to two population samples and at locus 1where and are the minor allele frequencies mafs of snp in samples and  and is s genotype at corresponding to homozygous major heterozygous and homozygous minor alleles respectively ie the frequency of minor allele in that individual the first term quantifies how different s maf is from s for a given locus  the second term quantifies how different s maf is from s at locus  and so gives the distance of relative to and at locus  since the minor allele frequencies and are computed by averaging the genotypes again written as  in samples and respectively it is clear that is the distance from to the centroid of along the coordinate and likewise for the term it can be seen from eq one that positive implies that is closer to than to  and that negative implies that is closer to than to 
 
by computing at each locus and taking the standardized mean across the loci 29 obtain a distance score which quantifies how close is relative to and across all loci under consideration2where denotes the mean of across all loci  that is provides a means to quantify whether s mafs are closer to s mafs or s mafs on average for the loci under consideration it is instructive to consider the geometrical interpretation of eq two point is clear upon inspection that the numerator in eq two is equal up to a factor of  to the difference in manhattan distances between and the nonstandardized centroid and and the nonstandardized centroid in this sense eq two resembles a nearestcentroid classifier however the denominator scales the relative distances by their variance across the snps that is a sample who is consistently closer to than to for each of the snps will obtain a higher than an individual who is variously closer to either across the snps under consideration
 
by assigning the non controls as and the non cases as  we can compute a statistic quantifying s distance to other cases relative to s distance to other controls if we then apply this systematically to all individuals in the study population removing that individual computing the mafs and for the remaining individuals who comprise and  and then computing in a leaveoneout manner we can obtain distributions of statistics in cases and controls that may be compared here the null hypothesis is that case and control distributions do not differ with the alternative hypothesis that the cases have higher values than do controls ie that they are closer via eqs 12 to other cases than are controls
 
we can use in the following manner to answer the questions posed above by applying it in a leaveoneout manner in each pathway
 
for a given pathway  select the snps associated with that pathway
 
for every sample  remove from the case or control group as needed and compute with respect to the remaining cases and controls using the snps chosen in step one point
 
quantify the differences in distribution of s for the case samples versus that of the controls and test for significance
 
by systematically carrying out the above steps on all pathways of interest we can identify pathways for which there appears to be differential homogeneity in cases and controls indicating that the pathway may play a diseaserelated role the details of the algorithm are explained below and summarized in table one point
 
in 30 we examined eqs 12 and found that the magnitude of is influenced both by the maf differences that is how distant the centroids of and are and by correlations between the snps under consideration due to the penalization for variance in provided by the denominator of eq two point these properties are extremely wellsuited to the application we propose pathways with few highlysignificant snps will yield large differences due to the influence of  as will pathways with snps that are highly correlated yet have subtle individual maf differences corresponding to the concerted action of multiple snps
 
at the same time however we wish to ensure that the pathways we select as having differential are not being influenced large ld blocks covered by the snps in the genes on the pathway that is we wish to ensure that the snp correlations which drive are reflective of epistatic effects between different genes rather than recombination events within a gene to this end we select a single snp to represent each gene based on the desire to detect multigene rather than multisnp effects
 
in practice snps are selected as follows for each pathway represented in the pathway interaction database 32 pid  containing annotations from biocarta reactome and the ncinature database 32 and kegg 33 we select the associated genes using dbsnp 34 we retrieve the snps associated with the pathway genes that are present in the data excluding those with missing data or with minor allele frequency in either case of control group we necessarily exclude pathways for which only one gene is probed by the remaining snps because we are interested in values that are driven by correlations across genes and not in individual genes covered by many snps with high ld we select for each gene its most significant snp in a univariate test of association fishers exact test it should be noted here that while the snp chosen for each gene is the most significant of that genes snps it is not necessarily significantly associated with disease our goal here is not to filter based on snp significance but rather to select for each gene a single marker that is as informative as possible
 
having selected the snps of interest we compute at each locus for every sample by selectively removing it and comparing it to the remaining cases and controls as described above for each pathway  we compute for the snps that comprise it yielding a distribution of for cases and another distribution for controls the difference in the location of the case and control distributions is then quantified nonparametrically by computing the wilcoxon rank sum statistic defined as3where is the rank of amongst all samples for a given pathway  eq three thus quantifies nonparametrically the degree to which cases are closer to other cases and controls closer to other controls across a set of snps for all individuals in the gwas
 
to illustrate the above we consider a simulated gwas of two hundred and fifty cases and two hundred and fifty controls and fifty snps shown in figure 1 and ask whether we are able to detect a 12snp pathway in which a subset of snps appear to have an epistatic interaction alleles were simulated as binomial samples from a source population with mafs ranging from zero point one to zero point four across the fifty snps and case labels were assigned such that a combintion of homozygous minor alleles at snps one and two or three ie  conferred a threefold relative risk mimicking an epistatic interaction between snps one and two and snps one and three figure 1a alone none of the fifty snps showed any association with case status nor was any snp significantly out of hwe in either cases or controls however the shared pattern in snps 13 is such that a twelve snp pathway comprising snps 112 yields greater in cases than in controls as can been seen in figure 1b while a random twelve snp pathway selected from the fifty snps that includes snp 3 but neither snp one or 2 shows no difference in values as seen in figure 1c
 
alleles at fifty loci for two hundred and fifty cases and two hundred and fifty controls were simulated such that each snp was in hwe and not associated with case status but homozygous minor red at both loci one and two or one and three yielded a threefold relative risk a a 12snp pathway comprising snps 112 shows differential distributions b a random 12snp pathway does not c boxplots are overlayed on the scatterplots of for clarity
 
while the wilcoxon statistic is normal in the largesample limit and can be directly compared to a gaussian to truly evaluate the significance of for a given pathway  we must address two sources of bias the number of snps per gene and the size of the pathway to address these issues we introduce a normalized pathway distinction score that we test for significance using a resampling procedure
 
first we expect that because we have selected for each gene the single most informative snp we are predisposed to seeing higher for pathways that contain large genes because large genes will be more likely to contain highlysignificant snps by chance the concern has been raised that 18 35 selecting the single most significant snp as a proxy for the gene as is done here will lead to a bias toward pathways that contain an abundance of large genes to account for this we follow the approach in 18 and normalize the score via a permutationbased procedure first we permute the phenotype labels and in each permutation recalculate as described above but using the permuted case and control labels the permuted labels are used both to select the most informative snp per gene and to compute   and in eqns 13 this yields a distribution of under the null hypothesis that the magnitude of is independent of the true casecontrol classifications we then normalize the true by the distribution from the permutation procedure yielding a distinction score for pathway that effectively adjusts for different sizes of genes and preserves correlations of snps in the same gene4where are the set of obtained for pathway across the permutations in practice one hundred permutations are used because the permuted labels are used in the snp selection this normalization adjusts for the bias introduced by the fact that large genes have more opportunity to contain significant snps by chance the pathway distinction score thus provides a modelfree genesize adjusted metric for quantifying the degree to which cases are closer to other cases higher  than controls
 
to test whether is significant we note that larger pathways may yield high values simply due to the fact that they sample the case anc control differences more thoroughly indeed the question of significance that we wish to address is not simply whether a pathway permits the distinction of cases and controls but whether it does so better than a random collection of as many snps wherein the snps are still selected to be the most informative by gene to account for the fact that the pathways are of differing sizes significance of the distinction score for a given pathway is assessed through resampling by choosing at random the same number of snps that are present in that pathway  from the total set of mostinformativesnppergene and recomputing for the random pathway the value is obtained by counting the fraction of random snp sets which give a larger than the true pathway snps in resamplings in this way we are able to detect pathways that yield large differences of case and control distributions due to their particular snps rather than simply being the result of choosing many snps the value obtained addresses the question of whether the pathway under consideration permits greater separation of cases and controls than would a random collection of mostinformativesnppergene ie whether there exists a more extreme aggregated effect in that pathway than expected by chance

wholegenome shotgun wgs sequencing of the genome of m graminicola used three libraries with insert sizes of 23 68 and 3540 kb the sequenced reads were screened for vector using crossmatch trimmed for vector and quality and filtered to remove reads shorter than one hundred bases wgs assembly was done using jazz a tool developed at the jgi 44 after excluding redundant and short scaffolds the assembly v10 contained fortyone point two mb of sequence in one hundred and twentynine scaffolds of which four point zero mb 75 was in gaps table s8 the sequence depth derived from the assembly was 888004
 
to perform finishing the m graminicola wgs assembly was broken down into scaffoldsize pieces and each piece was reassembled with phrap these scaffold pieces were then finished using a phredphrapconsed pipeline initially all lowquality regions and gaps were targeted with computationally selected sequencing reactions completed with 41 bigdye terminator dgtp chemistry applied biosystems these automated rounds included resequencing plasmid subclones and walking on plasmid subclones or fosmids using custom primers
 
following completion of the automated rounds a trained finisher manually inspected each assembly further reactions were then manually selected to complete the genome these included additional resequencing reactions and custom primer walks on plasmid subclones or fosmids as described above guided by a genetic map of more than 2031 sequenced markers plus pairedend reads from a library of bacterial artificial chromosome clones smaller repeats in the sequence were resolved by transposonhopping 8kb plasmid clones fosmid and bac clones were shotgun sequenced and finished to fill large gaps resolve larger repeats and to extend into the telomere regions
 
each assembly was then validated by an independent quality assessment this included a visual examination of subclone paired ends using orchid  and visual inspection of highquality discrepancies and all remaining lowquality areas all available est resources were also placed on the assembly to ensure completeness the finished genome consists of 39686251 base pairs of finished sequence with an estimated error rate of less than one in 100000 base pairs genome contiguity is very high with a total of twentyone chromosomes represented nineteen of which are complete and twenty of which are sequenced from telomere to telomere
 
both draft v10 and finished v20 assemblies of m graminicola were processed using the jgi annotation pipeline which combines several gene predictors1 putative fulllength genes from est cluster consensus sequences 2 homologybased gene models were predicted using fgenesh 45 and genewise 46 seeded by blastx alignments against sequences from the ncbi nonredundant protein set 3 ab initio gene predictor fgenesh 45 was trained on the set of putative fulllength genes and reliable homologybased models genewise models were completed using scaffold data to find start and stop codons ests were used to extend verify and complete the predicted gene models because multiple gene models per locus were often generated a single representative gene model for each locus was chosen based on homology and est support and used for further analysis those comprised a filtered set of gene models supported by different lines of evidence these were further curated manually during community annotation and used for analysis
 
all predicted gene models were annotated using interproscan 47 and hardwareaccelerated doubleaffine smithwaterman alignments wwwtimelogiccom against the swissprot wwwexpasyorgsprot and other specialized databases such as kegg 48 finally kegg hits were used to map ec numbers  and interpro hits were used to map go terms 49 predicted proteins also were annotated according to kog 50 51 classification
 
following the machine annotation manual validation and correction of selected gene sets was performed by more than thirty annotators through a jamboree held at the jgi facilities in walnut creek california usa annotators were trained by jgi staff and continue to make modifications as necessary
 
potential micrornalike small rna milrnas loci were annotated using the infernal software tool and based on four hundred and fiftyfour microrna families covarion models from the rfam database version nine point one 52 milrnas were predicted if their scores were higher than thresholds defined individually for each family in the same way as pfam domains are predicted
 
experimental validation of the predicted milrnas was done by sequencing of an rna library total rna was isolated from spores germinated on water agar of m graminicola isolate ipo323 a small rna library was prepared according to the protocol for illumina sequencing small rnas from 1650 nt were isolated from gels sequenced with an illuminasolexa single read dna fifty cycles genome analyzer ii and compared by blast search against the list of five hundred and thirtyfive predicted premilrnas from the genome sequence
 
assembly and annotations of the m graminicola finished genome are available from the jgi genome portal at  and were deposited at ddbjemblgenbank under the project accession acpe00000000
 
wholegenome tiling microarrays were designed by choosing one 50mer primer every one hundred bases spanning the entire finished genome the arrays were manufactured and hybridized by the nimblegen corporation with total dna extracted from each field isolate
 
the codonw package  was used for correspondence analysis of codon usage which mathematically is identical to principal component analysis codonw requires as an input a set of coding sequences usually of individual genes for chromosomelevel analyses coding sequences from the frozen gene catalog models for each chromosomes were concatenated forming twentyone superorfs one for each chromosome because partial models may introduce some potential frameshifts with internal stop codons they were removed from the analysis this did not affect the results as their total number is low codonw has no graphical outputs so they were used as inputs for scatter plots in r 
 
for m graminicola only a similar analysis was done for repeats repeatscout was run on the genome to produce a set of ab initioidentified repeat sequences from that set eightyone distinct repeat sequences each with an occurrence exceeding twenty times in the genome were extracted for each chromosome a vector of length eightyone was calculated with the relative frequency of each repeat a pc analysis was run on the resulting vectors using the standard principal component function pcomp in r separation at the repeat level means that these chromosomes have distinct evolutionary profiles not only on the proteincoding level but also on other parts of the chromosomes suggesting that entire chromosomes may be transferred horizontally
 
dot plots were generated via mummer three point zero 53 with data derived from default promer comparisons between the m graminicola genome assembly versions one and two  and s nodorum sn15 assembly version two 54 available under genbank accessions ch445325ch445384 ch445386ch445394 and ch959328ch959365 or aagi00000000 additional comparisons and statistical analyses were made with customdesigned perl scripts
 
data from the m graminicola version two comparison with s nodorum were used to test the efficacy of mesosyntenic comparisons to assist the completion of fungal genomes the mesosyntenybased prediction of scaffold joining involved three stages determining the percent coverage of scaffoldschromosomes for each scaffoldchromosome pair ie a function of the number of dots per block determining which scaffoldchromosome pairs were significantly related and forming groups of joined scaffolds and filtering out background levels of similarity due to sequence redundancy and incomplete genome assemblies
 
coordinates of homologous regions were obtained from promer coordinate outputs mummer 30 and used to determine the percent of sequence covered by matches to a sequence from the alternate genome for each sequence pair where match coordinates overlapped on the sequence of interest those matches were merged into a single feature to avoid redundancy a perl script for conversion of promer coordinate outputs to a table of percent coverage is available on request
 
coverage values for each m graminicolas nodorum sequence pair were subject to a binomial test for significance the threshold for significance psig095 waswhere x is the percent coverage n equals 100 and p is the probability of chromosome homology
 
the probability of chromosome homology p was equal to 12119 which was derived from the number of m graminicola chromosomes 21 and the approximate pfge estimate of s nodorum chromosomes 19 55 this is the likelihood that a given sequence pair represents related chromosomes this model assumes that no wholegenomechromosome duplication events have occurred previously between either fungal genome since divergence from their last common ancestor
 
the significance of percent coverage psig was tested bidirectionally for each sequence pair ie for sequence pair ab both coverage of sequence a by b and coverage of sequence b by a were tested sequence pairs were significantly related if a test in either direction was successful a minimum length threshold of one kb was also imposed for both sequences where multiple scaffolds of m graminicola were significantly related to the same s nodorum scaffold those m graminicola scaffolds formed a joined group of candidates for representation of the same chromosome
 
all possible paired combinations of m graminicola scaffolds present within predicted joined groups were subject to filtering for high levels of background similarity as followsthe retention score is a measure of the reliability of scaffold join relationships joins between m graminicola scaffold pairs with retention scores 025 were discarded
 
annotation of carbohydraterelated enzymes was performed using the carbohydrateactive enzyme database cazy annotation pipeline 26 blast was used to compare the predicted proteins of m graminicola to a collection of catalytic and carbohydratebinding modules derived from cazy significant hits were compared individually by blast to assign them to one or more cazy families ambiguous family attributions were processed manually along with all identified models that presented defects deletions insertions splicing issues etc
 
growth profiling of s nodorum and m graminicola was on aspergillus niger minimal medium 56 cultures were grown at twentyfive degrees for seven days after which pictures were taken for growth comparison carbon sources used were glucose sigma soluble starch difco alphacellulose sigma guar gum sigma galactomannan oat spelt xylan sigma and apple pectin sigma

since not all individuals homozygous for apol1 risk variants andor the myh9 e1 risk haplotype develop nephropathy the probability of developing esrd may depend on nongenetic factors and other genetic factors interacting with the known c22 risk variants thus a series of complementary logistic regression analyses were computed using the program snpgwa wwwphswfubmcedu the analyses were restricted to snps with minor allele frequencies 010 the primary inference for the following analyses used the additive genetic model for the snp provided there was no evidence of departure from the additive genetic model additive model lackoffit test pvalue5e2 if the lackoffit to an additive model was significant then the minimum of the dominant additive and recessive model is reported in addition additive genetic models required at least ten individuals homozygous for the minor allele and recessive models required at least thirty individuals homozygous for the minor allele
 
the primary analysis consisted of a caseonly test for an interaction between homozygosity for the myh9 e1 haplotype or apol1 risk variants g1g1 g2g2 g1g2 and individual snps across the genome specifically a logistic regression model was computed in cases where the binary outcome was homozygosity for apol1 risk snps or myh9 e1 haplotypes versus not homozygous and independent variables covariates were age gender first pc to account for admixture and snp the caseonly analysis makes the strong assumption that the snp being tested and homozygosity for the c22 variants are independent under the null hypothesis of no interaction if the assumption of independence under the null hypothesis is met this caseonly analysis can have considerably more statistical power than the corresponding classic casecontrol interaction model 28 to make the inference as robust to this assumption as possible the test was restricted to those snps not on c22 note by mendels law of independent assortment chromosomes are inherited independently and therefore the independence assumption is met this assumption was further examined by testing for the interaction in the control sample
 
as an aid to interpret the caseonly interaction analysis the corresponding classic twolocus logistic regression interaction model was computed here the logistic regression model had t2dmesrd status as the outcome and the predictor variables covariates of age gender pc the snp an indicator variable for two apol1 risk variants or myh9 e1 haplotype homozygosity and the centered crossproduct of the snp and indicator for c22 risk variant homozygosity here we mean the standard logistic regression model for two predictor variables say x1 and x2 with their interaction term a centered crossproduct eg z to reduce collinearitycorrelation among the variables specifically we would write this model as  where x1 is the snp and x2 is the indicator variable for the apol1myh9 haplotype see below respectively and z is the center crossproduct defined as  the variable z is defined in this way to reduce the collinearity or correlation among the predictors for better estimation properties the indicator variable is a binary variable that codes an individual as either zero or 1 depending on the characteristic of interest here the indicator variable was one if the person was homozygous for the apol1myh9 haplotype easily determinable as it is a recessive model and phase is unambiguous and zero if they were not homozygous for these risk haplotypes this binary 0 1 variable was included in the logistic regression model for the caseonly analysis this indicator variable was the outcome in the logistic regression analysis and for the classic twolocus interaction logistic regression models it was one of the predictor variables
 
subsequent analyses stratified by homozygosity at the myh9 e1 haplotype and apol1 risk variants a logistic regression model was computed in individuals homozygous for c22 variants where t2dmesrd status was the outcome and the independent variables covariates in the model included age gender the first pc and the snp of interest the analysis was repeated for individuals not homozygous for c22 variants and the test for homogeneity of the odds ratio was computed analyses in the replication cohorts paralleled those in the discovery cohort
 
to determine whether associated snps from analyses contrasting individuals with t2dmesrd to those without diabetes were dnassociated or t2dmassociated allele frequencies were compared between aa with t2dm lacking nephropathy to those in the combined t2dmesrd case groups and the combined nondiabetic nonnephropathy control groups
 
assuming a recessive model for the myh9 and apol1 risk variants with main effect or  15 haplotype frequency of 064 and an additive genetic model for the frmd3 snps having no main effect or  10 with minor allele frequency of 032 then with a type one error rate of   110 we have zero point five zero power to detect an or  two point zero five and zero point eight zero power to detect an or  234

for all experiments h pylori strains were initially grown for twentyfour hr on plates with bab medium uv mms and gamma irradiation sensitivity assays were performed as described 33 62 for chemical oxidative stress treatment h pylori od600  1 cell suspensions were incubated with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide 100 two hundred and three hundred mm cells were washed ten min later diluted with peptone broth and plated on bab plates survival was determined as the number of cells forming colonies on plates after a given treatment divided by the number of colonies from nontreated cells assays to determine spontaneous mutation rates were performed as described 7
 
all assays were performed at 37c for thirty min in twenty l reactions containing ten mm trishcl ph 79 fifty mm nacl ten mm mgcl2 one mm dithiothreitol two point five nm dna substrate see text s1 and table s1 and variable concentrations of pol i specified in the figure legends zero point one mm of either all four dntps or each dntp individually was included in the reactions except for the exonuclease activity assays when required as a control klenow fragment dna polymerase roche was used reactions were stopped by adding loading buffer 10 mm edta 95 vv formamide 003 wv bromophenol blue 003 wv xylene cyanol and subjected to electrophoresis in eight m ureacontaining 20 polyacrylamide gels gels were visualised and quantified using a molecular dynamics phosphorimager according to koskoska et al 63 bypass probabilities were calculated as the proportion of dna synthesis products extended beyond the lesion bypass efficiencies were then calculated for each enzyme and each substrate as the ratio of the bypass probability of a specific damaged base with respect to that of an undamaged nucleotide in the same position
 
the assay was performed as described previously 22 gapfilling dna synthesis was performed in a reaction mixture 25 l containing fifty mm tris ph 68 fifty mm nacl ten mm mgcl2 one mm dtt zero point two mm each of dntp and zero point two nm of gapped m13mp2 dna substrate reactions were initiated by adding pol i incubated at 37c for thirty min and terminated by adding edta to twenty mm when dna products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis 22 the majority of the gapped molecules were filled to completion however a minority of dna products migrated as if synthesis had paused at the palindrome just upstream of the open reading frame of the lacz gene in this minority population only about 75 of the template used to score errors had been copied as a consequence the lacz mutant frequency observed for the ensemble reaction products may slightly underestimate the error rate of h pylori pol i

the subjects enrolled in the gwas and in the replication study for wbc subtypes n  14792 and in the pleiotropic association study for hematological traits n  30454 consisted of patients that were classified into twentyseven disease groups tables s1 and s6 the subjects in the pleiotropic association study included the subjects in the gwas and the replication study all subjects were collected under the support of the biobank japan projects 22 subjects who were determined to be of nonjapanese origin by either selfreport or by pca in gwas were excluded from analysis some of the subjects in this study have also been included in our previous studies 17 21 45 46 all participants provided written informed consent as approved by the ethical committees of the biobank japan project 22 and the university of tokyo clinical information of the subjects including age gender and smoking history were collected by selfreport on the questionnaire the laboratory data including the counts of the wbc subtypes and other hematological traits were collected from medical records by the professional medical coordinators according to the standardized protocol 22 the details of the study enrolled by the charge consortium including subject details and the study design are described at length elsewhere 23 and are summarized in table s5
 
in the gwas for the wbc subtypes 592232 snps were genotyped for 8943 subjects using illumina humanhap610quad genotyping beadchip we excluded seventyseven subjects with call rates 098 in the process of genotyping after this initial exclusion snps with call rates 099 or with ambiguous clustering of the intensity plots or nonautosomal snps were excluded we excluded sixtyseven closely related subjects based on the identitybydescent ibd which was estimated using the genome option implemented in plink version one point zero six 47 for each pair with a 1st or 2nd degree of kinship we excluded the one member of the pair with lower call rates than the other we then excluded subjects whose ancestries were estimated to be distinct from eastasian populations using pca performed by eigenstrat version two point zero 24 we performed pca for the genotype data of our gwas along with the genotype data of phase ii hapmap populations unrelated european ceu african yru and eastasian jpt  chb individuals release 24 25 based on the pca plot of the subjects we visually identified and excluded five outliers in terms of ancestry from jpt  chb clusters subsequently the snps with maf 001 or with an exact pvalue of the hardyweinberg equilibrium test 10107 were excluded finally we obtained 481110 snps for 8794 subjects
 
after the quality control criteria mentioned above were applied genotype imputation was performed using mach one point zero 26 in a twostep procedure 46 the genotype data of phase ii hapmap jpt and chb individuals release 24 25 were adopted as references in the first step of the imputation recombination and error rate maps were estimated using five hundred randomly selected subjects from those enrolled in the gwas in the second step genotype imputation of all subjects was performed using the estimated recombination and error rate maps quality control filters of maf 001 and rsq values 07 were applied for the imputed snps
 
the genotype data of the snps enrolled in the replication or pleiotropic association study were obtained from the genomewide screening data of the biobank japan project 22 genotyping was performed using either illumina humanhap550v3 genotyping beadchip or illumina humanhap610quad genotyping beadchip and the same quality control filters and imputation procedure were applied
 
the common logtransformed values of the counts of each of the wbc subtypes were adjusted for gender age smoking history and the affection statuses of the subjects with the disease groups table s1 using linear regression by r statistical software version 2110 then the residuals were normalized as z scores and the subjects with z score 40 or 40 were excluded in each of the traits associations of the snps with the counts of the wbc subtypes were assessed by linear regression assuming the additive effects of the allele dosages on the z scores using mach2qtl software 26 in the replication and pleiotropic association studies the association of the snps with the normalized residuals were also evaluated by the linear regression as univariate analysis for each of the phenotypes the transformation methods used for the hematological traits in the pleiotropic association study are summarized in table s6 combined study of the results of the gwas and the replication study was performed using an inversevariance method from the summary statistics of beta and standard error se through the combined study of the gwas and the replication study the locus which satisfied the genomewide significance threshold of p50108 was considered to be significant we did not account for multiple comparisons among the traits these significantly associated loci were subsequently enrolled in the pleiotropic association study for the selection of the loci that were evaluated in the replication study we adopted less stringent threshold of p50106 to include potentially associated loci for the evaluation of the identified loci using the caucasian populations bonferroni correction based on the number of the evaluated loci were adopted   005 n  12 p0004 ld between the snps in the mhc region and hla alleles were estimated using the genotype data of the snps and the highresolution hla alleles for phase ii hapmap jpt and chb individuals 25 29 explained proportions of the variations of the wbc subtypes by the combination of the associated snps were estimated based on the differences of the coefficient of determination r2 in the multivariate linear regression model for commonlog transformed counts of the respective wbc subtypes including the associated snps as covariates and the model additionally including age gender smoking history and the affection statuses of the subjects as covariates explained proportions of the correlation between the two wbc subtypes by the associated snps were estimated based on the following statistics r2resi1  r2resi2  r2nomi where r2nomi is the r2 between the logtransformed values of the counts of the wbc subtypes r2resi1 is the r2 between the residuals of the values adjusted for gender age smoking history and the affection statuses of the subjects and r2resi2 is the r2 between the residuals of the values adjusted for gender age smoking history the affection statuses of the subjects and the snps significance of the statistics was evaluated using permutation procedure  one hundred and nine iteration steps

the subjects participating in the gwas consisted of a total of 16388 selfidentified africanamerican individuals from seven populationbased cohorts aric cardia jhs whi handls health abc and genestar that belong to the continental origins and genetic epidemiology network cogent detailed descriptions of each participating cogent cohort their quality control practices and studylevel analyses are provided in the text s1 clinical information of the subjects was collected by selfreport and clinical examination all participants provided written informed consent as approved by local human subjects committees we excluded study participants on the basis of pregnancy cancer or aids diagnosis at the time of blood count measurement
 
certified staff obtained fasting blood samples at the baseline clinic visit samples for complete blood count cbc analysis were obtained by venipuncture and collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta total circulating wbc count and cell subtype counts were performed at local clinical laboratories using automated hematology cell counters and standardized quality assurance procedures 4 6 4951 total wbc count was reported in millions of cells per ml and was recorded in all 16388 study participants information on wbc subtype was available only in a subset of 7477 456 participants from aric cardia jhs handls genestar and health abc wbc differentials were performed by clinically certified hematology laboratories the absolute numbers of each type of wbc were calculated by multiplying the proportion of the wbc count comprised by each cell type by the total wbc measure to evaluate normality of the phenotypes for subsequent regression analyses we performed boxcox likelihood ratio tests on raw wbc phenotypes on this basis all wbc traits were natural log transformed to normalize the distributions of the phenotypic data
 
genomewide genotyping was performed within each cogent cohort using methods described under text s1 dna samples with a genomewide genotyping success rate 90 duplicate discordance or sex mismatch genetic ancestry outliers as determined by cluster analysis performed using principal component analysis or multidimensional scaling snps with genotyping success rate 95 monomorphic snps snps with minor allele frequency maf 1 and snps that map to several genomic locations were removed from the analyses significantly associated snps were examined for strong deviations from hardyweinberg equilibrium andor raw genotype data examined for abnormal clustering participants and snps passing basic quality control were imputed to 22 million snps based on hapmap2 haplotype data using a 11 mixture of europeans ceu and africans yri as the reference panel details of the genotype imputation procedure are described further under text s1 prior to discovery metaanalyses snps were excluded if imputation quality metrics equivalent to the squared correlation between proximal imputed and genotyped snps were less than 050
 
for all cohorts genomewide association gwa analysis for quantitative wbc traits was performed using linear regression adjusted for covariates implemented in either plink v107 52 or mach2qtl v108 allelic dosage at each snp was used as the independent variable adjusted for primary covariates of age agesquared sex and clinic site if applicable to adjust for population stratification and global admixture the principal components were also incorporated as covariates in the regression models see text s1 for genestar family structure was accounted for in the association tests using linear mixed effects lme models implemented in r 53 although the jhs has a small number of related individuals extensive analyses showed that results were concordant using linear regression or lme after genomic control therefore results are presented for jhs using linear regression for imputed genotypes we used dosage information ie a value between 0020 calculated using the probability of each of the three possible genotypes in the regression model implemented in plink and mach2qtl for cohorts with unrelated individuals or the maximum likelihood estimation mle routines for genestar
 
for each wbc phenotype metaanalyses were conducted using inversevariance weighted fixedeffects models to combine beta coefficients and standard errors from study level regression results for each snp to derive a combined pvalue and effect estimates study level results were corrected for genomic inflation factors  by incorporating study specific  estimates into the scaling of the standard errors se of the regression coefficients by multiplying the se by the squateroot of the genomic inflation factor the inflation factors for all completed analyses are presented in table s1 metaanalyses were implemented in the software metal 54 and were performed independently by another analyst to confirm results betweenstudy heterogeneity of results was assessed by using cochrans q statistic and the i two inconsistency metric for each genomewide significant or replicated locus cohort specificresults and overall wbc effect estimates and confidence intervals are summarized using forest plots figure s3 and s4 the mean and standard deviation wbc count for each genotype class is provided in table s8
 
to maintain an overall type one error rate of 5 a threshold of   25108 was used to declare genomewide statistical significance this threshold has been suggested for african ancestry populations based on estimates of 2 million independent common variant tests in african genomes 55
 
given the nonlinear nature of the original phenotype we performed a sensitivity analysis of whether our results are robust to the assumption of an additive genetic model we repeated the gwa analysis for the whi aric cardia jhs cohorts the four largest african american cohorts n  13694 using a two degree of freedom genotypic model as well as a dominance deviation test and metaanalyzed the results using metal
 
to assess in the cogent africanamericans wbc traitassociated loci previously reported in europeans or japanese we evaluated the africanamerican metaanalysis results for each index snp in the regions reported including consistency of direction of effect and assessed statistical significance by a simple bonferroni adjustment based on the total number of snps assessed using a 2sided hypothesis test in addition we performed a more exploratory assessment of all snps within a five hundred kb window that were correlated in african americans with the european or japanese index snp in hapmap ceu or chbjpt r205 we adjusted these exploratory regional analyses for multiple testing based on the effective number of snps taking into account pairwise linkage disequilibrium patterns
 
to further assess the potential existence of multiple independent variants influencing a trait at the same locus allelic heterogeneity regression analyses were repeated conditional on the most strongly associated index snp in that region each study repeated the primary gwa analysis additionally adjusting for the lead snp in each region under the appropriate regression models the cohortspecific results were then metaanalyzed in the same way as for the primary gwa study using metal
 
replication of novel association findings was performed using gwa data in three other ethnic populations 3551 hispanic american women from whi 14767 japanese from riken and 19509 european americans from charge further details of each study population are provided under text s1 both genotyped and imputed snp data were available in the european and japanese samples while only genotyped snp data were available in the hispanic americans to further localize the causal variant responsible for the cxcl2wbc association we extended the association analysis to include all genotyped and imputed snps within a five hundred kb region centered at rs9131 the snp most strongly associated with wbc count in african americans we then performed a transpopulation metaanalysis of each snp in this region by combining test statistics from the african american cogent european charge and japanese riken association analyses using fishers method 56 which may have some advantages over the standard metaanalytic approach in this setting 37 nonetheless we also performed a standard inverse varianceweighted metaanalysis using either fixed or random effects 57 and obtained results similar to fishers method
 
for betweenstudy gwa platform consistency we estimated locusspecific ancestry using affymetrix six point zero genotyped snp data from the four largest africanamerican cohorts whi aric jhs cardia which constitute 85 of our total cogent african american sample for each african american locusspecific ancestry probabilities of whether an individual has 0 1 or two alleles of african ancestry at each locus was estimated using a hidden markov model and local haplotype structure to detect transitions in ancestry along the genome 58 59 phased haplotype data from the hapmap ceu and yri individuals were used as reference panels to assess the impact of local ancestry on any genomewide snp associations each of the four cohorts repeated each snp genotypewbc phenotype linear regression model adjusting for local ancestry proportion as a covariate in addition we stratified the snp genotypewbc phenotype association test on the number of estimated local european chromosomes 1 versus 1 to compare whether variants in genomewide significant regions have the same versus different effect on african and european ancestral population backgrounds the cohortspecific results of these analyses were combined using metal
 
in the genestar family study variance components models in the assoc subroutine of sage 60 were used to derive maximum likelihood estimates of polygenic narrowsense heritability  two g using naturallog transformed unadjusted or covariateadjusted phenotype data the statistical significance of the heritability estimate was obtained using a likelihood ratio test in each of the seven cogent african american cohorts the fraction of variance explained was estimated using the formula 2pq 2 where p is the frequency of the effect allele of the snp q  1p and  is the additive effect in each population estimated by standardizing wbc to have standard deviation one point

genotype data was further filtered maf  5 and hardyweinberg p106 using all samples and imputed to the ceu hapmap two ceur22b36fwd genotypes using mach 23  imputation results were filtered such that r2  030
 
association analysis was performed on the genotype data in plink 24 using logistic regression adjusting for study in the gaintgen sample and using the dosage command with the predictor being the maximum likelihood estimate of the number of alleles at the locus format  1 adjusting for up to ten mds components did not alter the genomic inflation factor so they were not included as covariates
 
wtccc genotype data was downloaded in tped format and filtered as described in the accompanying documentation genotype calls were filtered based on chiamo quality scores 090 snps were filtered according to snp lists provided by the wtccc including snps that were excluded based on poor genotype clustering and individuals were filtered according to individual lists provided by the wtccc for a total of 459075 snps 1868 bipolar disorder bd cases 1926 coronary artery disease cad cases 1748 crohns disease cd cases 1952 hypertension ht cases 1860 rheumatoid arthritis ra cases 1963 type one diabetes t1d cases 1924 type two diabetes t2d cases 1458 united kingdom blood services nbs controls and 1480 one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight british birth cohort 58c controls
 
association for wtccc samples was performed in plink using logistic regression without any covariates for each phenotype cases were analyzed against both nbs and 58c control sets metaanalysis was performed in plink using the metaanalysis command fixed effects pvalues are reported
 
snps that were genotyped in both wtcccbd and gaintgen were used to generate scores for each individual in gaintgen odds ratios from wtcccbd were natural log transformed and used as a score in the snp scoring routine of plink subsets of snps achieving different pvalue cutoffs were used such that weakly associated snps were progressively added to strongly associated snps snps were pruned to linkage equilibrium r205 using the indeppairwise command in plink with a sliding window of fifty snps and a five snp step snps were clumped to independent associations using the clump command in plink index snps were selected at p01 with a secondary threshold of p01 r205 and a two hundred and fifty kb window logistic regression was used to test for association between score and casecontrol status in r 25 glm command the lrm command was used to calculate a pseudor2 statistic
 
summarylevel data was obtained from a metaanalysis of height using a genotyping chip targeting genes related to cardiovascular disease covering 49320 snps and about 2000 genes we used the natural division of the phase i cohort consisting of 53394 individuals of european ancestry as our discovery set and the collection of phase ii cohorts consisting of 37052 individuals of european ancestry as our test dataset we performed metaanalysis on the phase i and phase ii samples using metal as described 19
 
power was calculated using the pwrf2test function from the pwr package in r with one degree of freedom in the numerator n2 degrees of freedom in the denominator where n is the number of individuals with genotype data for the snp in the test dataset alpha of 005 and effect size f2 the effect size f2 was calculated asr2 was calculated aswhere beta is the effect size from the metaanalysis and s is standard deviation in the study height was expressed in cm and was not standardized to a zscore the standard deviation of height was calculated as the sample sizeweighted standard deviation across all discovery data sets 92 cm and the standard deviation of the snp was calculated from the allele frequencies assuming hardyweinberg equilibrium because a proportion of snps were only tested in a small number of samples we filtered the 20 of snps with the lowest sample sizes to test the role of sample size on initial effect estimates studies were progressively added to the discovery data and the metaanalysis was repeated on each subset of the data
 
power was calculated based on association results from wtccc bipolar cases and controls nbs58c 26 snps were additionally filtered for maf 1 in order to calculate power the noncentrality parameter was calculated given the odds ratio or from wtccc minor allele frequency in wtccc controls and the number of case and control samples in the tgengain combined sample 27 or and maf were rounded to two decimals power was calculated using gpower three 28 given the noncentrality parameter and an alpha of 005
 
associations between power and replication at p005 or consistency of effect size were performed using logistic regression in r using the glm command family  binomiallogit for plots smoothing was performed using the smoothspline function in r
 
for both height and bd samples we performed simulations in r to show that given the observed effect size we would expect to see replication rates associated with power linearly with a slope of one point we sampled three hundred and sixtyone snps from each study across power levels with nineteen snps from each 5 power bracket we simulated a population of 1000000 individuals with genotypes based on the allele frequency given hardyweinberg expectations for the bd casecontrol study an individuals risk of disease was 1 multiplied by the odds ratio raised to the power of the number of risk alleles they carried if this risk was greater than a random number between zero and 1 then they were considered affected for each snp we performed one hundred permutations sampling cases and controls in numbers to match the gaintgen sample and performed logistic regression the observed replication rate is the proportion of tests that reached p005 for the quantitative height example a individuals baseline height in standard deviations was modeled using a random number as a quantile of the normal distribution using the command qnorm in r the observed effect of the snp was then multiplied by the number of risk alleles and added to the baseline height for one hundred permutations per snp a random sample of individuals corresponding to the number of individuals tested for that snp in the phase ii study was taken and association was tested using linear regression
 
exon location in the refseq genes was determined from refgene table  for each snp the closest exon within one mb was determined and the distance to that exon calculated if a snp was within an exon a distance of zero was used an indicator variable of whether the snp was within two kb or twentyfive kb of an exon was used in logistic regression

wbc phenotypes were derived from data provided by fluorescence activated cell sorting technologies commonly employed in clinical and epidemiological studies to interrogate common hematological elements found in peripheral blood total wbc count was reported in thousands of cells per ml and subtype specific cell counts were calculated by multiplying the proportion of the wbc count comprised by each cell type by the total wbc measure any subject with a trait value greater than two sd from the corresponding mean of that trait in each cohort or missing data for any assayed phenotype were excluded from all analyses shapirowilk tests of normality were implemented in the smallest discovery cohorts as the data was available at the time of study design the inchianti study and the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa to evaluate normality of the phenotypes for analyses raw values natural log transformed and squareroot transformed values for each phenotype of interest in these two studies were compared with regard to deviations from normality based assessment of the shapirowilk test statistic in the two studies based upon these reviews a uniform analysis plan was established for conducting each studylevel analyses analysis using either log transformation total wbc count neutrophil count and monocyte count or squareroot transformation basophil count eosinophil count and lymphocyte count in order to normalize the distributions of the phenotypic data
 
at the study level gwas analyses were conducted on unrelated participants except for fhs of confirmed european ancestry based on either multidimensional scaling or principal components analyses concordance between genotypic and selfreported gender and successfully genotyped at 95 of attempted snps snps were filtered based on criteria of minor allele frequency 001 maf missingness per snp5 and hardyweinberg equilibrium pvalue100e7 hwe used to exclude poorly clustered genotypes participants and snps passing basic quality control were imputed to 24 million snps based on hapmapii haplotype data all studies utilized multivariate linear regression to generate study level summary statistics for each phenotype with allelic dosages at each snp used as the independent variable and primary covariates of age at hematology assay current smoking status and sex detailed descriptions of participating studies their quality control practices and studylevel analyses which may differ slightly from those described above are provided in text s1
 
to conduct metaanalyses all studies submitted summary statistics from the studylevel linear regression analyses for each phenotype metaanalyses were conducted using inversevariance weighted fixedeffects models to combine beta coefficients and standard errors from study level regression results for each snp to derive a combined pvalue prior to discovery metaanalyses snps were excluded if imputation quality metrics equivalent to the squared correlation between proximal imputed and genotyped snps were less than 030 study level results were also corrected for genomic inflation factors gc by incorporating study specific gc estimates into the scaling of the standard errors se of the regression coefficients by multiplying the se by the squareroot of the genomic inflation factor see table s1 for study and phenotype specific genomic inflation factors 81 study specific genomic inflation factor estimates for all discovery cohorts were all 105 except for one point one two in the health abc analysis of basophil count and one point zero nine in the analysis of total white blood cell count in ages table s1 no definitive cause of this inflation could be identified and of particular interest the genomic inflation factors for related traits in these two studies were within the normally accepted range metaanalyses were implemented using metal and independently reanalyzed using r to confirm results 82
 
we chose a priori to carry over all results from discovery metaanalyses at pvalues500e08 to replication metaanalyses excluding any snps with cochrans q test of heterogeneity pvalues001 or missing in more than two studies these conservative exclusion criteria caused the exclusion of six of one hundred and sixtyseven genomewide significant snps from replication analyses and these snps did not constitute any new loci of interest the final number of snps for replication analyses was then reduced to one hundred and sixtyone candidate snps across all phenotypes for replication metaanalyses of individual snps each phenotype was analyzed separately using similar inversevariance weighted metaanalyses as in the discovery stage analyses although no genomic control was used pvalues for significant associations in the replication stage were corrected for the number of snps tested per phenotype using the standard bonferroni correction for multiple testing total wbc count corrected for sixtythree snps with a significance threshold of pvalue794e4 neutrophil count corrected for fortysix snps with a significance threshold of pvalue109e3 basophil count corrected for one snp with a significance threshold of pvalue005 lymphocyte count corrected for fourteen snps with a significance threshold of pvalue357e3 and monocyte count corrected for thirtyseven snps with a significance threshold of pvalue135e3 of the one hundred and sixtyone candidate snps included in the replication phase one hundred and fiftytwo snps passed the traitspecific replication pvalue thresholds ony one genomewide significant locus failed to replicate and this locus on chromosome 1q22 contained only one genomewide significant snp associated with monocyte count in the discovery phase
 
of the one hundred and fiftytwo successfully replicated associations one hundred and nine snps were unique since some snps were significant across multiple phenotypes these replicated snps were analyzed in grail to infer a possible biological connection between significant metaanalysis loci grail was used to mine textual data based on pubmed keywords to examine functional relatedness across phenotypes based on inferred biological interconectivity between genes proximal to metaanalysis results snp rs identifiers for these associated snps were input into the grail webserver as a means of specifying genomic regions of interest in constructing query and seed regions to be analyzed genes for text mining of the functional datasource were identified using the ld structure of hapmap2 release twentytwo ceu samples gathering gene identifiers to search indexed abstracts from pubmed last curated on may two thousand and ten point genes in regions of interest were clustered based on keyword similarity these genes and clusters were then scored based on ranked similarity adjusting for gene size to generate pvalues evaluating the strength of the functional interconnectivity of genes in the regions of interest pvalues for these functional clusters were then falsediscovery rate adjusted fdr to correct for multiple testing with the fdr adjusted pvalue of zero point zero five considered the threshold for significance
 
for the eqtl analysis five hundred and one participants with complete genotyping data from the inchianti study were also successfully assayed on illumina ht12v3 genomewide expression arrays using rna isolated from whole blood quality control of the genomewide expression data included the exclusion of probes with detection pvalues001 with missing data for greater than 5 of participants samples must have been assayed with at least 95 of the filtered probe sets passing quality control in order to be included in analyses
 
five thousand and ninetyfour probes passed quality control and were subsequently cubicspline normalized prior to analysis in the investigation of possible ciseqtl associations at regions of interest identified in the metaanalysis all probes within five hundred kb of successfully replicated snps from the metaanalysis were identified based on annotations from remoat  83 thus we tested seven hundred and fortyone possible ciseqtls multivariate linear regression was implemented using plinkv107 84 testing the dosage of minor alleles as a predictor of gene expression level for each probe these linear regression models were adjusted for hybridization batch amplification batches sex smoking study site and age at baseline of study the pvalues generated by each analysis was corrected for the number of tests with a minimum threshold of significance at pvalue675e05

all microarray data for eqtl analysis were normalized with the bioconductor implementation of the mas50 algorithm wwwbioconductororg composite interval mapping was performed with qtl cartographer v117j using a walking speed of two cm window size of ten cm and five background markers 39 eqtl that exceeded individual ewt were extracted using a python script such that two peaks within close proximity were declared different eqtl if the distance between peaks was greater than two lod 46 individual ewt were computed using a combination of python scripts bash shell scripts and qtl cartographer briefly composite interval mapping was performed using the same criteria in the eqtl analysis except the data were permuted prune with reselection of background markers srmapqtl a total of 1000 times 41 42 maximum lod scores were stored and the 95th quantile   005 was selected as the individual ewt
 
the over and undersaturation of eqtl were identified using a contingency 2 test on the ratio of tdmeqtl for a region as compared to the entire experiment to fulfill the requirements of this contingency 2 test we merged successive bins in the genetic map until the sum of observed eqtl and tdms was greater than seventythree for inoc and eightyfive for mock for each set of bins the same bins were used to analyze both experiments by incorporating the distribution of eqtl in mock and inoc in parallel
 
a bootstrap approach was used to estimate the significance associated with alternate regulation in the inoc and mock data sets for genes with eqtl in both data sets using the maximum lod eqtl genetic regions were compared with nonoverlapping merged bins superbins that were generated with a greedy approach this approach required a minimum number of tdms and eqtl in inoc 73 tdm and eqtl and mock 85 tdm and eqtl to be placed within a superbin hence the same bins in each experiment were collected into a single superbin this approach is similar to that used for the identification of transeqtl hotspots and regions for oversaturation of differentially expressed genes see results two strategies were used to account for 1 alternate regulation on the same chromosome and 2 regulation on different chromosomes between inoc and mock for both genes were redistributed from mock using probabilities determined by the distribution of eqtl in inoc based on the eqtl histogram this was repeated 1000 times for the maximum lod eqtl in the overlap between inoc and mock probabilities were generated differently for the first and second strategies by including all genes with eqtl 10127 genes in inoc and mock or only those genes with maximum lod eqtl on a different chromosome between data sets 5538 genes bootstrap pvalues were determined by comparing the observed overlap versus the 1000 bootstrapped samples
 
gene ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using agrigo v10  52 singular enrichment analysis sea was performed using the default parameters fisher test the yekutieli multitest adjustment method a significance level of 005 and a minimum number of five mapped entries using the complete set of gene ontology terms parametric analysis of gene set enrichment page was used with sea default parameters with a difference in requiring a minimum of ten mapped entries and fdr cutoff at 01

plants were grown hydroponically in a growth chamber as described by famoso et al 8 al tolerance was determined based on relative root growth rrg after three days in al 160 m al3 or control solution the hydroponic solution used in this study was chemically designed and optimized for rice al tolerance screening for a detailed comparison of the phenotypic procedures employed in this work compared to previously published rice al tolerance work see famoso et al 2010 to obtain uniform seedlings eighty seeds were germinated and the thirty most uniform seedlings were visually selected and transferred to a control hydroponic solution for a twentyfour hour adjustment period after the twentyfour hour adjustment period root length was measured with a ruler and the twenty most uniform seedlings were selected and distributed to fresh control solution 0 um al3 or al treatment solution 160 um al3 plants were grown in their respective treatments for 72 hours and the total root system growth was quantified using an imaging and root quantification system as described by famoso et al 2010 the mean total root growth was calculated for al treated and control plants and rrg was calculated as mean growth almean growth control the three hundred and seventythree genotypes screened for al tolerance and used in the association analysis are part of a set of four hundred o sativa genotypes that have been genotyped with 44000 snps as described by zhao et al 65
 
the qtl populations consisted of a population of one hundred and thirtyfour recombinant inbred lines rils derived from a cross between azucena tolerant tropical japonica and ir64 susceptible indica 67 70 and a population of seventyeight backcross introgression lines bils derived from a cross between nipponbare tolerant temperate japonica and kasalath susceptible aus and backcrossed to nipponbare the al3 activity at which al tolerance was screened was determined by identifying the al3 activity that provided the greatest difference in tolerance between the parents the tolerant parent of the ril population azucena and the tolerant parent of the bil population nipponbare are similar in al tolerance whereas the susceptible parent of the ril population ir64 is significantly more tolerant than the susceptible parent of the bil population kasalath figure 1a to ensure that a normal distribution was obtained in each population a different al3 concentration was used for each mapping population the ril population was screened at two hundred and fifty m al3 because the azucena parent is very al tolerant and the ir64 parent is only moderately susceptible the bil population was screened at one hundred and twenty m al3 because the kasalath parent is extremely al sensitive though the nipponbare parent is very al tolerant figure one displays the al tolerance of each mapping parent in reference to the three hundred and seventythree genetically diverse rice accessions screened at one hundred and sixty m al3 the genetic component of the phenotypic variance was calculated as varg  vargvargxeerror qtl analysis was conducted using composite interval mapping cim function in qtl cartographer 81 the significance threshold was determined by one thousand permutations
 
genomewide association analysis was performed using three approaches in all samples 373 with phenotypes the first approach was the naive approach which is simply the linear regression of phenotype on the genotype for each snp marker the second approach was principle component analysis pca where we obtained the four main pcs principle components that reflect the global main subpopulations in the sample to correct population structure estimated from software eigensoft 82 the first four pcs are included as cofactors in the regression model to correct population structure 
 
here  and  are coefficient vectors for snp effects and subpopulation pcs respectively and are the corresponding snp vector and first four pc vectors and is the random error term the third approach was the linear mixed model proposed by 62 63 implemented in the r package emma 71 which models the different levels of population structure and relatedness the model can be written in a matrix form as y  xcze where  and  are the same as above both of which are fixed effects and is the random effect accounting for structures and relatedness is corresponding design matrices and is the random error term assume n02gk and en02ei and k is the ibs matrix as in 62 we also conducted gwa using both the naive approach and the mixed model approach in each of the four main subpopulations ind aus tej trj for the mixed model the model was changed to y  xzue since there was no main subpopulation division within each subpopulation sample linkage disequilibrium decay and haploblocks were calculated at specific chromosomegene regions using haploview software 83
 
population structure was analyzed employing expectationmaximization techniques on an hmm model of permarker ancestry along a chromosome with a weak linkage model between adjacent markers on the same chromosome induced by the hmms state dependence on the previous markers subpopulation assignment m wright cornell university personal communication the 5467 snps used for admixture analysis were a subset of the 36901 high quality snps on the fortyfour k chip and were selected based on their information content and ability to distinguish genetic groups rather than individuals the two main criteria used to select the subset of snps were a good genomic distribution and minimal ld among those used in the analysis and b maf005 in at least one subpopulation the state of the hmm at each marker corresponds to the subpopulation of origin for the marker and by extension the region containing the marker and its adjacent markers the number of a priori distinct subpopulations was k  5 consistent with that reported previously by garris et al two thousand and five and ali et al two thousand and eleven 40 66 a set of fifty standard nonadmixed control lines ten representing each of the garris et al subpopulations that were genotyped on the fortyfour k rice snp array were used to develop and evaluate the method all fifty lines were correctly assigned to each of the subpopulations and concordant with previous results using structure 84 with little or no admixture or introgressions detected the emhmm method was favored over the corresponding linkage model of recent versions of structure because the emhmm model explicitly modeled inbreeding and estimated the inbreeding coefficient for each line independently permitting lines in various stages of purification or inbreeding to homozygosity to be analyzed the lines phenotyped in this study that were also genotyped on the fortyfour k snp array were then analyzed combined with these fifty control lines and the local ancestry along chromosomes were assigned by maximizing the state path of the hmm while simultaneously estimating subpopulation specific allele frequencies using the forwardbackward algorithm using this method introgressions from a foreign subpopulation into a line with a vast majority of the genetic background originating from a single subpopulation were detected

human subject committees of the participating institutions approved the study the discovery dataset was nested in the neurogenetics research consortium ngrc gwas which successfully identified known pd genes as well as a novel association with hla 5 which has been widely replicated 10 19 for the present gwais replication samples were provided by peg 20 parkinson environment and gene page 21 parkinsons genes and environment from the prospective nihaarp diet and health study cohort and hihg 9 hussman institute for human genomics persons with pd had been diagnosed by neurologists using standard criteria 22 control subjects selfreported as not having pd cases and controls were all unrelated nonhispanic caucasian from united states the ngrc cohort was clinicbased sequentially ascertained patients peg and page were communitybased incident cases hihg was clinicbased and selfreferral cases the numbers of casescontrols with genotype coffeecaffeine and key clinical and demographic data were ngrc  1458931 peg  280310 page  5251474 hihg  209133 table s1
 
ngrc peg and hihg had collected lifetime caffeinatedcoffee consumption data measured as cups per day multiplied by the number of years of consumption ccy 12 23 page had daily mg caffeine intake from all caffeinecontaining drinks and foods for twelve months prior to enrollment 19951996 and only incident pd cases diagnosed after one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven were included in the analysis 24 despite the variation in data collection results were consistent across studies corroborating robustness of the interaction between coffeecaffeine and grin2a we could not and did not attempt to distinguish the bioactive ingredient in caffeinatedcoffee although caffeine has been shown to be neuroprotective there may be other ingredients in caffeinatedcoffee that may affect disease pathogenesis to classify coffeecaffeine intake each dataset was treated separately according to the measurements available the median ccy or mg was determined for controls within each dataset excluding those with zero intake and used as the cutoff for heavy drinkers median vs light drinkers 0 to median the median was sixtyseven point five ccy for ngrc seventyfour point zero ccy for peg seventy point zero ccy for hihg and two hundred and thirtyseven point eight mgday for page for coffee dose quartiles were defined for each dataset using the full range from zero to maximum intake in controls results shown for ngrc peg and hihg are based on lifetime caffeinatedcoffee consumption truncating coffee use at ageatonset or ageatdiagnosis in patients did not affect the results to assess the effects of caffeinated tea and soda we performed sensitivity analysis in ngrc dataset caffeinated soda and tea were commonly and equally consumed by heavy and light coffee drinkers soda 80 in both heavy and light drinkers caffeinated tea 66 in heavy coffee drinkers and 61 in light coffee drinkers we repeated gwais and stratified gwas with caffeinated soda and tea as covariates we also explored association of caffeinated tea and soda with pd expecting an inverse association if caffeine were the bioactive ingredient in coffee
 
the source of dna was whole blood for ngrc and hihg saliva for page and whole blood all pd and half of controls or saliva half of controls for peg ngrc was genomewide genotyped using illumina humanomni1quadv10b array and achieved 9992 call rate and 9999 reproducibility gwas genotyping and statistical quality control qc have been published 5 811597 snps excluding y chromosome snps because they are not amenable to sex adjustment passed gwas qc and were included in gwais replication groups genotyped grin2ars4998386 only one snp was genotyped for replication we have no other undisclosed replication results peg and hihg used abi taqman assaybydesign c2801872120 page used sequenom and all achieved call rates of 9699
 
the first step was to test the hypothesis that the effect of coffee on pd risk is affected by a gene ie test statistical interaction between snps and coffee genomewide theoretically a test of snpcoffee interaction would have been suitable however a pure test of interaction has low power reportedly it requires more than four times the sample size that gwas would require to detect a main effect of similar size reviewed in 2 we chose the joint test of snp main effect and its interaction with coffee as proposed by kraft et al 15 we call the test gwais for genomewide association and interaction study the main advantage of the joint test is that it does test for interaction and it has more power than pure interaction test when there is a modest snp marginal effect next we performed stratified gwas in heavy and light drinkers to gain insight to where the interaction signal was coming from and to formulate a hypothesis for replication we then replicated the top signal and performed pooled analysis methods for metaanalysis of the joint test are available 25 26 however since we had individual level data we pooled the datasets
 
the genomewide genotypes for ngrc had been cleaned previously for gwas using standard rigorous measures 5 we had identified two significant principal components pc1 pc2 marking jewishnonjewish ancestry and european countries of origin 5 sex was a significant variable because pd affects more men than women and our data has a significant gender disparity table s1 controls were older than patients at age at onset which was by design to minimize the chances that controls were too young to have developed the disease nevertheless we controlled for age at enrolment both for patients and controls to avoid confounding by agerelated factors we examined coffee consumption and the most significant snp for potential variation by disease related variables recruitment sites and ethnic and geographic origins of subjects table s2 smoking was a potential confounder because it is correlated with coffee use and is an independent inverse risk factor of pd thus we repeated all analyses with smoking included as a covariate in the model table s3 without smoking as covariate table s4 with smoking as covariate we also repeated analyses with caffeinated tea and soda in the model table s5 for details on how the data on tea soda and smoking were collected in ngrc see 12
 
811597 snp genotypes 5 and lifetime caffeinatedcoffee consumption data 12 from one thousand four hundred and fiftyeight persons with pd and nine hundred and thirtyone controls from ngrc were analyzed we tested the following models snpcoffeesnpcoffeecovariate vs coffeecovariate henceforth referred to as snpsnpcoffee joint test 15 critically the main effect of coffee on pd risk was present in both models being compared thus we controlled for coffee in the test this model conducts a two degrees of freedom df joint test of snp marginal effect and its interaction with coffee on pd risk 15 sex age pc1 and pc2 were included as covariates we used likelihood ratio test statistics as implemented in plink 27 and tested the dominant additive and recessive modes of inheritance gwais was repeated once with the addition of smoking as a covariate and again by addition of caffeinated tea and soda as covariates
 
there were five hundred and twelve cases and three hundred and eightyseven controls in the heavy coffee drinking group and nine hundred and fortysix cases and five hundred and fortyfour controls in the light coffee drinking group we tested association of 811597 snps with pd in each group using standard gwas with one df we used plink 27 and adjusted for age sex pc1 and pc2 stratified gwas were repeated with smoking caffeinated soda and caffeinated tea added as covariates tables s4 and s5
 
based on the main finding in discovery we specified the replication hypothesis apriori as follows among heavy coffee drinkers carriers of rs4998386t allele have a lower risk of pd than carriers of rs4998386cc genotype note that we were using the gwais as a means to identify the genes that might enhance the inverse association of coffee with pd with the goal of carrying the discovery forward to pharmacogenetic studies hence the replication hypothesis was framed as specified we used three datasets for replication peg 20 page 21 and hihg 9 we tested betweenstudy heterogeneity using breslowday test statistics there was no heterogeneity in coffee use in rs4998386cc or in rs4998386tc genotype frequencies but rs4998386tt frequency which is quite rare varied significantly across studies there were a total of twentysix cases and twentysix controls with rs4998386tt genotype in discovery and replication combined we found no trend in rs4998386tt subject characteristics that could help pinpoint the source of heterogeneity table s6 given the unanticipated heterogeneity in rs4998386tt we performed genotypespecific analysis comparing tc to cc excluding tt as well as dominant and additive models which included tt categorical data were analyzed using logistic regression in sas version 92 and were adjusted for age and sex and for source of data when data were pooled age at onset was analyzed as a continuous variable using linear regression in sas
 
p values were twosided for discovery onesided for replication given the clear directional prior hypothesis 28 and two sided when discovery and replication were pooled there is no agreedupon significance threshold for gwais the bonferroni corrected threshold for all 811597 snps on the array is p64108 however not all 811597 snps are independent due to linkage disequilibrium ld simplem 29 provides a sound bonferronibased multiple testing correction method for gwas based on the estimated number of independent tests allowing for markertomarker ld it was shown to be the best approximation for permutation which is computationally prohibitive for gwas using simplem we calculated the number of independent snps genomewide for ngrc as meff  430151 thus the bonferroni corrected threshold for independent tests was p116107
 
we used impute v2 30 with hapmap and one thousand genomes genotypes combined as reference data to infer genotypes for snps that were not originally included on the illumina omni1 array and thus not genotyped in the ngrc dataset 2710971 snps were imputed with high reliability information score 095 and had maf001 increasing the genomic coverage to 3522568 snps total genotyped and imputed we performed gwais and stratified gwas for the grin2a region chromosome 16 ninetyseven mb102 mb using genotype probability data dose 20 in r software 
 
linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks were estimated using the haploview software 31 haplotype analysis was performed using hapstat adjusting for sex and age 32
 
we used golden helix snp variation suite version 723  and penncnv 33 to explore for deletions or duplications in the grin2a region golden helix found no cnvs penncnv identified two controls with cnvs which even if confirmed to be real would not affect the results of the study

for the present study the care consortium genotyped the ibc snp chip 15 in twentythree thousand seven hundred and sixtyseven european americans and eight thousand one hundred and ten african americans as well as the affymetrix six point zero chip in seven thousand three hundred and eightytwo african americans the ibc array contains nearly 50000 snps across 2000 loci snps were selected using a tagging approach among populations represented in hapmap and the seattlesnps project the array was designed to focus on candidate loci related to cardiovascular disease and its risk factors more details can be found in the design paper 15 table s1 details the genotyping that was conducted for the care study cohorts quality control and imputation were conducted centrally using mach 1016  imputation results were filtered using thresholds rsqhat value of zero point three and minor allele frequency 001 fractional counts between zero and two were coded for the imputed genotypes in order to estimate the number of copies of a prespecified allele for european samples the ceu population from hapmap two 254 million snps was used as the reference panel
 
for african american samples a 11 combined hapmap two ceuyri reference panel was used this panel includes snps that were present in both populations as well as snps segregating in one panel and monomorphic and nonmissing in the other 274 million altogether since the african american samples were genotyped for both the affymetrix six point zero and ibc arrays we were able to analyze imputation performance at nongenotyped snps the use of the ceuyri panel resulted in an allelic concordance rate of 956 calculated as one  12imputeddosage  chipdosage for imputation on the affymetrix chip this is similar to rates obtained from african ancestry participants imputed using hapmap two yri individuals 39
 
trait creation details are described above renal function indices performed centrally but within each individual study genomewide association analyses and ibc chip analyses of natural logtransformed egfr uacr ckd and ma were conducted using linear and logistic regression with an additive genetic model we adjusted for age sex and study site when applicable and the first ten principal components relatedness was accounted for when necessary using linear mixed effect lme models for egfr and uacr and logistic regression via generalized estimating equations gee for ckd and ma additional details regarding the discovery cohorts are in text s1
 
principal components were generated using eigenstrat 40 within each study using the care african ancestry affy60 genotype data two reference populations were included in the principal component analysis of african americans 1178 european americans from a multiple sclerosis gwa study from dr phil de jager and colleagues and seven hundred and fiftysix nigerians from the yoruba region from a hypertension gwa provided by dr richard cooper and colleagues importantly these two underwent extensively quality control procedures to remove population outliers using pca ten principal components were generated for each study and used to adjust for population substructure
 
we performed fixedeffect metaanalyses of the ibc chip and genomewide association data using the inversevariance weighted approach in metal  genomic control correction was applied after calculating the inflation factor lambda  within each individual study and after the genomewide association metaanalysis was performed
 
the standard threshold of p5108 for genomewide significance in the genomewide association and p20106 in the ibc chip analyses was used the rationale for the pvalue threshold used for the ibc chip is based on an empiric test of the number of independent loci 25000 that appear on the ibc array 17 we selected independent snps pairwise r202 at each locus for replication
 
the r software v290 was used for data management statistical analyses and graphing
 
we developed a set of criteria to validate the lead snps and interrogate regions around each of the loci that were previously reported among european ancestry ea participants 3 4 in our african american aa care samples for each lead snp in ea we lookedup the respective association result with egfr in aa to accommodate the difference of ld structure and possible allelic heterogeneity across different ethnicities we then interrogated the two hundred and fifty kb flanking region around each lead snp to determine whether there exist other snps with stronger associations with the outcome we used the following criteria to identify the top aa snp 1 the snp with the smallest association pvalue within the region 2 maf 003 3 location of the aa lead snp within the same recombination block of the lead ea snp where the recombination block was defined as a 20 recombination rate the statistical significance of each identified snp was evaluated using a regionspecific bonferroni correction we determined the number of independent snps based on the variance inflation factor vif which was calculated recursively within a sliding window with size fifty snps and pairwise r2 value of zero point two using plink
 
finally each identified top snp in aa was sent for replication in additional independent aa samples
 
similar to the interrogation in aa for the ea lead loci we also interrogated the newly identified loci from the care gwas and the ibc chip in ea participants of the ckdgen consortium
 
replication analyses were performed using imputed in silico genomewide association data replication studies conducted the same association analyses as the stage one phase details regarding the replication cohorts can be found in text s1
 
replication was performed as follows metaanalysis was conducted in the stage two studies only and then in the stage one  stage two studies combined replication was defined as a directionconsistent stage two beta coefficient replication pvalues are thus represented as onesided tests snps were declared to replicate when the pvalue in the stage one  stage two studies combined was smaller than the pvalue in the stage one alone
 
the correlation between lnuacr and lnegfr can range from nonsignificant to as high as zero point two three seven p0001 in our study therefore we examined the crosstrait associations across albuminuria and egfr phenotypes

freshly collected flies were washed twice in 25 bleach and twice in sterile water the entire gut was dissected in sterile insect saline and placed in sterile tes buffer 10 mm trishcl ph  75 one mm edta one hundred mm nacl for flies stored in ethanol dissection was not feasible because weakening of the fly tissues caused the gut to fragment for these samples the entire fly body was used after three washes with sterile water to ensure adequate removal of external bacteria each final wash was confirmed to be free of bacterial cells by pcr with universal bacterial primers and by plating onto rich media in no case did the final wash show evidence of bacterial contamination for a single sample d melanogaster reared in the kopp laboratory the first wash was saved for dna extraction to characterize the external bacterial community seven to twenty fly bodies or guts were combined for most samples in one exception d melanogaster bodies collected from rotting grapes sample maw only a single body was used on a single occasion the bacterial community of laboratory media within the kopp laboratory was sampled using one ml of media that had been inhabited by d melanogaster for 710 days further details regarding sample collection dates locations and contents can be found in dataset s1
 
dna was extracted from samples using a modification of the bead beater protocol 93 the tissue was homogenized by grinding and three freezethaw cycles on dry ice samples were then incubated with fifty unitsml of lysozyme for fifteen minutes next physical disruption was performed in a beadbeater biospec products inc bartlesville ok on the homogenize setting for three minutes an overnight incubation with 1 sds and two mgml proteinase k was followed by extraction with an equal volume of 25241 phenolchloroformisoamyl alcohol the aqueous phase was incubated at room temperature for thirty minutes with two point five volumes of 100 isopropanol and zero point one volumes of three m sodium acetate before centrifugation at 16000 g for thirty minutes at 4c the dna pellet was washed with cold 70 ethanol and allowed to air dry before resuspension in te 10 mm trishcl ph 75 one mm edta
 
approximately one hundred ng of dna was used as template for smallsubunit rdna 16s amplification bacterial universal primers 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag and 1492r 5ggttaccttgttacgactt were used to amplify a 1450 bp fragment lane 1991 these primers were chosen for three reasons first although they are not truly universal they are specific to a region that is conserved in many groups of bacteria 94 second they allow for the amplification of nearly the full length of the gene therefore providing consistent comparisons to previous studies of 16s rdna diversity 95 finally both of these primers have been used in many similar surveys of bacterial diversity including a previous study of bacterial diversity in drosophila melanogaster 32 using these primers allows our results to be directly comparable to those previous studies the pcr conditions were as follows initial denaturation for five minutes at 95c thirty or thirtyfive cycles at 95c for thirty seconds 55c for thirty seconds and 72c for two minutes final extension for ten minutes at 72c these pcr conditions were used for all samples with an annealing temperature of 55c chosen from a temperature gradient study of 48c to 58c because it produced the maximum product yield the 16s rdna amplicons were cloned into the pcr4topo vector using the topo ta cloning kit clones were transformed chemically into one shot top10 chemically competent e coli cells or via electroporation into electromax dh10b e coli cells invitrogen carlsbad ca and plated onto agar plates with xgal and either fifty mgml kanamycin or fifty mgml ampicillin colony pcr 20 colonies was used to verify a 10 insertless rate and 15 kb insert size white colonies were arrayed into 384well plates prior to sequencing plasmids were amplified by rolling circle amplification using the templiphi dna sequencing amplification kit amersham biosciences piscataway nj and sequenced from both ends using the m13 28 or 40 primers with the bigdye kit applied biosystems foster city ca sequencing reactions were purified using magnetic beads and run on an abi prism three thousand seven hundred and thirty applied biosystems sequencing machine
 
vector and primer sequences were removed with crossmatch a component of the phrap software package 96 97 and bases with a phred quality score of q  fifteen were converted to ns using jazz the joint genome institutes inhouse assembly algorithm when possible overlapping regions from the forward and reverse reads of each clone were used to assemble a single contiguous sequence for each clone in cases where the overlap was not sufficient for assembly custom perl scripts were used to concatenate the forward and reverse reads with gaps inserted between them see below all sequence data are available via biotorrents  and have been submitted genbank under the accession numbers jn420379 through jn426767
 
we used the infernal one point zero software 98 to create a single multiple sequence alignment for all of our samples infernal creates a hidden markov model hmm based on a highquality reference alignment with a fixed length of one thousand five hundred and thirtytwo point two thousand and seventyeight of the four thousand one hundred and ninetyeight clones consisted of nonoverlapping paired reads for those we created a 5alignment of reads beginning with the 27f primer sequence and a 3alignment of reads ending with the reverse complement of the 1492r primer sequence and merged the two alignments inserting gaps into the intervening columns based on positions in the reference alignment the concatenated sequences from this merged alignment were combined with the successfullyassembled fulllength clones to create a single multiple sequence alignment this alignment is available via biotorrents 
 
for the purposes of otu operational taxonomic units 99 definition and phylogenetic inference this multiple sequence alignment was further refined to remove column blocks that contained 80 gaps this resulted in the removal of the first eleven 111 and last one hundred and thirtytwo 14001532 positions as well as positions 642806 164 positions from the middle of the alignment which primarily corresponded to the regions of nonoverlap between reads a custom perl script was used to remove sequences with fewer than three hundred remaining nucleotides from this trimmed alignment chimeric sequences were identified and removed using the chimeraslayer function within mothur v111 35
 
we submitted our sequences to the ribosomal database project rdp10 classifier for taxonomic assignment 100 to the genus level we were unable to submit a single fulllength sequence for every 16s clone that was sequenced because for 50 of our clones there was no overlap between the forward and reverse reads for each clone we assigned taxonomy independently to the 5 read the 3 read and to the fulllength or concatenated reads with intervening gaps inserted as described above and then selected a single taxonomy assignment for each 16s clone we used the measures of confidence bootstrap values that are associated with the rdp taxonomy predictions to guide the selection process most investigators agree that 70 bootstrap support is indicative of strong support for a phylogenetic clade 101 in order to arrive at taxonomy predictions with very high confidence we only considered taxonomy assignments that had bootstrap values of 75 at the genus level 80 at the family level 95 at the order level and 100 at the class level strongly supported disagreements between the 5 3 and combined data sets were rare 72 total sequences these were handled in one of two ways 1 if the conflict was at the level of family or above they were considered likely to be chimeric sequences and excluded from further analysis or 2 if the conflict was within a single family the genus name was changed to unclassified
 
we used the mothur program 35 to generate a distance matrix using our trimmed infernal alignment of three thousand two hundred and fortythree sequences as input using the distance matrix created by mothur sequences were clustered using the average neighbor algorithm using the zero point zero three cutoff option 97 sequence similarity all sequences fell into one hundred and thirtynine otus the average otu abundance was twentythree point three sequences min  1 max  638 a representative sequence from each otu was selected using the getoturep function within mothur this representative sequence and the distseqs command in mothur was used to calculate genetic distances between otus and representative sequences throughout this study
 
taxonomy predictions generated by rdp were mapped onto each sequence within an otu in many cases this led to a clear reassignment of unclassified sequences to the genus level based on the dominant genus present in that otu in other cases the entire otu was comprised of unclassified sequences these otus were assigned names based on their phylogenetic position relative to the reference sequences included either from the rdp type strains from other drosophila bacterial microbiome studies or from genbank
 
all seven thousand four hundred and fortyeight good quality 16s sequences longer than one thousand two hundred bp from bacterial type strains were downloaded from the rdp website on 82210 100 these representatives are usually the first identified or most fully characterized strains within a bacterial lineage although closely related bacteria may differ substantially in genome content inclusion of these type strains provides important phylogenetic landmarks during tree building all seven thousand four hundred and fortyeight strains were aligned using infernal and the resulting alignment was trimmed to remove the first eleven 111 and last one hundred and thirtytwo 14001532 positions as well as positions 642806 164 positions from the middle of the alignment as described above
 
all sequences from previous studies of drosophila bacterial communities 32 33 corbyharris unpublished were downloaded from genbank mothur was used to create a distance matrix and otus were created at a 97 similarity cutoff the getoturep function was used to pick a representative sequence for each otu additional drosophilaassociated sequences were also included 21 37 finally for otus in our study that do not have any closely related sequences within the rdp database such as enterobacteriaceae group orbus the closest blast hits from genbank were included a list of the rdp and genbank accession numbers for sequences used in the final tree are found in the dataset s5
 
to compare our results to mammalian studies the 17504 ultraclean sequences from 12 were analyzed to obtain a sample that was roughly equal to our data in taxonomic breadth only the sequences from artiodactyla carnivora and primate samples were analyzed these sequences were aligned and trimmed as above and a full pca analysis was performed using the fast unifrac interface 62 taxonomic classifications were done with rdp 100
 
diversity measurements were calculated for each library from both drosophila 33 and mammalian 12 datasets using mothur 35 the proportion of otus unique to each library was calculated for each group as in ley et al 2008a 12
 
using representative sequences from our dataset previously identified drosophilaassociated bacteria representative type strains from the rdp database and sequences obtained from genbank see previous section a phylogenetic tree was created with fasttree 36 default settings with the gtr generalized timereversible model were used the entire tree was rooted using thermus thermophilus rdp identifier s000381199 after an initial run with all 8407 sequences many clades were removed from the alignment for example bacterial phyla in which no drosophila associated sequences were present the remaining one thousand three hundred and fortynine aligned sequences were then rerun on fasttree using the settings described above final publication quality images were prepared using dendroscope 102
 
tests of significance of differences between samples were performed using unifrac and fastunifrac 61 62 the low depth of coverage provided by the sequencing method used is sufficient to find significant results using unifrac 103 because of the correction for multiple comparisons pairwise comparisons for each library were not feasible with the amount of data collected we therefore parsed all data into bins representing different host diets to estimate the overall effect of this factor the effect of different experimental treatments was determined similarly all comparisons of bacterial communities are given in the text s1 cooccurrence tests were also performed as in 104 but inadequate power precluded the finding of any significant cooccurring pairs of taxa additional details in text s1
 
unless explicitly stated flies were fed unsterilized standard lab media text s1 all transfer steps were performed near a bunsen burner flame and all surfaces and instruments were frequently sterilized with 70 ethanol for bacterial dna extraction flies were washed to remove external bacterial cells and their intestines dissected as described above all negative controls were confirmed to be bacteriafree by plating onto mrs media and pcr with universal bacterial primers separate libraries were created from adult cantons males oregonr males and oregonr females for deborah kimbrells lab ucdavis ca in addition a large population of wild d melanogaster originally collected from winters ca was established in the kopp lab for use in dietary treatment experiments strain wo
 
for diet experiments approximately twentyfive flies were transferred to each of five separate diets with one vial per treatment the diets included standard lab media high yeast media high yeast supplemented with 6 ethanol sugaragar and agar only see text s1 for media composition all media were initially sterilized in an autoclave with the exception of the standard lab media ethanol was added to the ethanol treatment after media cooled below 55c to reduce the effect of the mediadwelling bacterial population that arose after contact with nonsterile flies cultures were transferred daily to fresh sterile media with the exception of the standard lab diet these transfers continued for three days on all media except the agaronly diet where starvationinduced death limited the experiment to two days four hours after the final transfer the intestines of ten flies per treatment were dissected for analysis
 
for the multiple species experiment approximately twentyfive adults each of d melanogaster d elegans and d virilis were combined on sterilized high yeast media after three days of daily transfers as above ten males per species were dissected for analysis

the discovery stage of the gwas included 8938 caucasian men of european descent drawn from seven epidemiological cohorts the framingham heart study fhs the study of health in pomerania ship the gothenburg osteoporosis and obesity determinants good study the cooperative health research in the region of augsburg kora study the health aging and body composition health abc study the rotterdam study rs1 and the invecchiare in chianti inchianti table s1 the replication stage consisted of 4620 men from two epidemiological cohorts the european male ageing study emas and the osteoporotic fractures in men mros sweden study for de novo genotyping of the top snps and one additional cohort the young finns study yfs n  871 with genomewide association data available and joining the study after stage one was finished for in silico replication table s2
 
exclusion criteria included chemical or surgical castration andor medications affecting sex hormones such as steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitors and sex hormone antagonists all studies were approved by local ethics committees and all participants provided written informed consent characteristics of the study samples and detailed descriptions of the participating cohorts genotyping methods quality control and imputation procedures are provided in text s1
 
altogether 25 million snps imputed using the hapmapii ceu population were tested for association with serum testosterone in the discovery stage genomewide association analyses using an additive genetic linear regression model adjusted for age bmi and current smoking were conducted twice within each of the discovery cohorts using serum testosterone expressed as ngdl as well as inversenormal transformed serum testosterone as outcomes
 
to examine the robustness of the discovery results and to reduce the risk of spurious associations due to possible testosterone measurement heterogeneity between the individual cohorts three different types of metaanalyses were performed in the discovery stage 1 an inversevariance weighted fixed effect model 2 a zscore based analysis of the untransformed serum testosterone concentrations and 3 a zscore based metaanalysis of the inversenormal transformed values model 1 was used as main analysis since it allowed the computation of effect estimates whereas the other two analysis models were used for verification and quality control checks of the main findings all metaanalyses were performed using metal wwwsphumicheducsgabecasismetal the random effects model of the two shbg locus snps was calculated using the rpackage metafor wwwrprojectorg imputed genotypes were analyzed in all cohorts taking the genotype uncertainties into account genomic control was applied to each individual cohorts results and to the discovery stage metaanalysis to correct pvalues for potential effects of mild population stratification the estimated genomic control lambda was low for both the individual cohorts range of gc 100107 and the metaanalyses range of gc 101102 suggesting little residual confounding due to population stratification figure s2
 
to reduce the variance on serum testosterone induced by shbg concentration the gwas included a genomewide test for association of untransformed serum testosterone concentrations adjusted for age bmi current smoking shbg and shbg2 concentrations again using both an inversevariance weighted fixed effect as main analysis and a zscore based metaanalysis for quality control purposes
 
a threshold of p5108 was established a priori as the level for genomewide significance in the discovery analyses 30 snps that reached genomewide significance in the inversevariance weighted metaanalysis of untransformed serum testosterone concentrations with or without adjustment for shbg and which had association results in at least five of the seven cohorts for chr x two cohorts with data available were selected for further analyses notably all autosomal snps that fulfilled these criteria also reached genomewide significance in the other two types of metaanalyses from these snps all independent snps were taken to the replication stage
 
we also assessed whether the lead snps from the continuous trait analyses were associated with low serum testosterone concentration defined as 300 ngdl 16 this level is slightly lower than that suggested recently by wu et al 11 nmoll  three hundred and seventeen ngdl 17 by binary logistic regression including the same covariates in the model used for the main analysis and metaanalyzing the withincohort results using inversevariance weighted fixedeffect model the kora cohort was not included in the metaanalyses of low serum testosterone as testosterone was measured using plasma in this cohort
 
we determined the number of low serum testosterone concentration risk alleles 0 to 4 for the two lead snps of the shbg locus in each individual and assessed the risk of low serum testosterone concentrations in the three replication cohorts mros sweden emas and yfs using a trend test since only two subjects in the replication cohorts had four risk alleles individuals having three and four risk alleles were grouped into one category to obtain more reliable effect estimates during the subsequent analyses details of test for independence shbg related analysis of the top snps and quality control steps performed can be found in text s1
 
methods for the measurement of serum testosterone and shbg are given in text s1 calculated free testosterone was for all subjects with both testosterone and shbg available n  13833 table one and table 2 calculated by using a modified law of mass action equation as described by mazer 31 the concentrations of testosterone and shbg and a fixed value for shbgs dissociation constant were used in these calculations
 
free testosterone fraction was measured by an equilibrium dialysis method in eightyseven subjects with the cc genotype and thirtytwo subjects with the ct genotype of rs6258 figure 3d 32 detailed description of the free testosterone fraction measurements is provided in text s1
 
in experiments evaluating shbg binding capacity serum shbg concentrations were determined by twosite immunofluorometric assay perkinelmer life sciences turku finland 33 or by a steroidbinding capacity assay 34 for steroidbinding assays serum samples were preincubated with dextrancoated charcoal dcc to remove endogenous steroids prior to incubation with either 3h5dihydrotestosterone 3hdht specific activity fifty cimmol or 3htestosterone specific activity forty cimmol bound from free 3hsteroid were separated using dcc as the separation reagent 34 the steroidbinding properties of shbg in diluted serum samples or tissue culture medium were determined by scatchard analysis 34 for the expression of shbg protein wild type corresponding to the c genotype of rs6258 and rs6258 corresponding to the t genotype of rs6258 shbg cdnas in the prccmv expression vector were transfected into cho cells and g418 was used for selection of stably transfected cells at near confluence cells were washed with pbs and cultured in serumfree sfm4cho medium thermo scientific hyclone logan ut for four days before the shbgcontaining medium was harvested

this study arose from a collaboration between investigators from two national institute of health funded consortia examining the genetic basis of common complex diseases the population architecture using genomics and epidemiology page study a national human genome research institute funded effort examining the epidemiologic architecture of common genetic variation that have been reproducibly associated with human diseases and traits 55 and the care consortium 56 a national heart lung and blood institutesupported resource for genetic analyses examining cardiovascular phenotypes briefly page investigators participating in the phenomics working group wanted to extend existing efforts examining evidence for pleiotropy in approximately three hundred replicated genetic variants 57 to include a more comprehensive evaluation of common snps a collaboration between page and care investigators was therefore initiated and used data from five care studies of european american and african american with adequate phenotype data aric cardia chs fhs and mesa all participating institutions and care sites obtained institutional review board approval for this study additional information on the participating care studies is provided in text s1
 
the institute for the translational medicine and therapeutics itmatbroadcare ibc genotyping array 58 was used to evaluate approximately 2100 genes related to cardiovascular inflammatory hemostasiscoagulation and metabolic phenotypes and pathways the ibc array tagging approach was designed to capture maximal genetic information for both common and lower frequency snps 5 minor allele frequency maf in hapmap as well as european american and african american populations the array included 49320 snps 15000 of which were gene variants not present in hapmap additional details of the snp selection and tagging approach are given in text s1
 
imputation of untyped and missing snp genotypes was performed using mach 1016 59 for the european samples phased haplotypes from the ceu founders of hapmap two were used as reference for african american populations a combined ceuyri reference panel was created that includes snps segregating in both ceu and yri as well as snps segregating in one panel and monomorphic and nonmissing in the other imputation for the ibc array was performed in two steps first individuals with pedigree relatedness or cryptic relatedness were filtered a subset of individuals was randomly extracted from each panel and used to generate recombination and error rate estimates for the corresponding sample second these rates were used to impute all sample individuals across the entire reference panel before cleaning there were an average of 246740 range 245816 247505 and 227224 range 225111 229061 imputed snps in the european american and african american study populations respectively imputation results were then filtered at an imputation quality limit of zero point three zero and a maf threshold of 001 yielding 235077 953 of total and 227222 962 of total snps for analysis in european american and african american participants respectively
 
the clustered risk factors of interest were characterized as a sixdomain phenotype atherogenic dyslipidemia vascular dysfunction vascular inflammation prothrombotic state elevated plasma glucose and central obesity figure 1 these domains were constructed a priori based on a review of literature examining clustering in metabolic phenotypes placing specific emphasis on the national cholesterol education programs adult treatment panel iii report 4 60 nineteen variables were then selected to represent one of the six domains with preference for variables measured in at least four of the contributing cohort studies or variables that were highly correlated with available measures measurement protocols for each variable by study are provided in table s21 we assessed normality and transformations were used when variables exhibited excessive skewness or kurtosis as determined by numerical summary information and visual inspection of histograms and normal probability plots dimension reduction using principal components analysis was then performed for each phenotype domain separately in each raceethnic and study population for example principal components for the vascular inflammation domain were calculated using the following traits albumin c reactive protein fibrinogen uric acid and white blood cell count principal components were chosen so that55 of the variance for each domain was explained tables s12 s13 s14 s15 s16 s17 s18 s19 s20 this threshold was chosen because all of the first waist circumference prothrombotic state elevated plasma glucose and vascular dysfunction and the sum of first and second vascular inflammation and atherogenic dyslipidemia principal components exceeded 55 across all studies and racialethnic groups
 
for each phenotype we fit a linear regression model relating the phenotype to the snp genotype under the additive mode of inheritance the model includes environmental variables ie age sex and study center as well as the first ten principal components from eigenstrat to adjust for population substructure 61 ten population substructure components were included because each component was associated with at least one of the eight phenotypes of interest in at least one study if the snp genotype is not associated with any phenotype domain then the regression coefficients for the snp genotype are zero in all eight linear models we tested this global null hypothesis by constructing a multivariate test statistic based on the joint distribution of the score statistics from the eight linear models which accounted for the correlation between the eight phenotypes we chose the score statistic because it is computationally efficient and numerically stable the test statistic is referred to the chisquared distribution with eight degrees of freedom the genomewide significance level was set as p213107 ie 005235077 qq plots by race are not presented as our use of a genecentric array highly enriched for metabolic loci complicated the identification of markers with low prior probabilities of association ie null markers for all phenotypes of interest the data from each cohort were analyzed separately and the results were combined via metaanalysis as described in text s2 all analyses were stratified by race and were performed in sas nine point one and c further details are given in the text s2

embryos were collected fixed and prehybridized according to standard protocols which are available at  and described in 6 26 briefly d yakuba and d pseudoobscura cages were maintained at 23c d yakuba embryos were collected for three hours and aged for two hours prior to fixation d pseudoobscura embryos were collected for three hours and aged for three hours prior to fixation embryos were dechorionated in 50 bleach for three minutes washed and fixed in a 14 solution of 10 formaldehyde polysciences 04018 to heptane for twenty minutes with vigorous shaking the vitelline membranes were removed by shaking with meoh and washed 3x with 100 meoh fixed embryos were stored at 20c in 100 ethanol embryos were pooled for prehybrization rehydrated in pbt  tx pbs ph 72 005 tween20 and 02 triton x100 postfixed for twenty minutes in 5 formaldehyde in pbttx washed in hybridization buffer 50 formamide 5x ssc ph 52 02 triton x100 forty gml heparin and two hundred and fifty gml salmon sperm dna and incubated at 55c for one to five hours in hybridization buffer prehybridized embryos were stored in hybridization buffer at 20c
 
there were two modifications to the staining protocol developed for d melanogaster 6 first speciesspecific rna probes were made using cdna or genomic dna as a template whereas cdna probes were used exclusively for the d melanogaster data probes ranged in size from five hundred and thirtyone bp to two thousand seven hundred and seventyone bp and either encompassed the majority of the coding sequence or overlapped large exons table s4 variation in probe length did not significantly affect our measurements figure s11 second two different haptens are required for our imaging pipeline one for the registration gene and one for the gene of interest while dinitrophenol dnp  labeled probes gave consistently clean results in all species digoxygenin dig  labeled probes yielded variable levels of background another commonly used hapten biotin was even worse because dig stains were strong enough to reliably distinguish stripes we chose to use it for the registration channel but not include the data in the final gene expression atlases
 
probe templates were cloned by pcr amplification using either genomic dna or cdna libraries as a template ligated into pgemteasy and sequence verified cloning primers are listed in table s4 probe templates were generated by pcr with m13 forward and reverse primers antisense digoxygenin dig or dinitrophenol dnp probes were synthesized using in vitro transcription from dna templates using either sp6 or t7 polymerase depending on the orientation of the clone probes were not carbonatetreated as this did not improve stain quality all probes were diluted to two hundred ngl
 
for in situ hybridizations approximately one hundred l of embryos were incubated for up to fortyeight hours at 5557c in three hundred l of hybridization buffer with 210 l each of a dig and dnp probe embryos were then washed extensively with hybridization buffer at 5557c and probes were detected sequentially using horseradishperoxidase hrp conjugated antibodies antidig pod roche eleven billion two hundred and seven million seven hundred and thirtythree thousand nine hundred and ten at 1250 or 1500 antidnp perkin elmer nel747 a001kt at 1100 and either coumarin or cy3 tyramide amplification perkinelmer nel703 001kt sat 704b to disable the hrp in the first signal detection reaction embryos were washed in hybridization buffer at 55c and incubated in 5 formaldehyde in pbttx for twenty minutes all remaining rna was removed by incubation with zero point one eight gml rnase a in five hundred l pbttx overnight at 37c nuclei were detected by staining with sytox green molecular probes s7020 15000 in five hundred l overnight at 4c embryos were dehydrated in an ethanol series and mounted in xylenebased depex electron microscopy service 13514 on a slide with two bridging coverslips to prevent flattening of the embryos detailed protocols are available at 
 
threedimensional image stacks of individual embryos were acquired semiautomatically on a zeiss lsm seven hundred and ten using a planapochromat 20x 08na objective embryos were located staged using phase contrast optics and the imaging parameters such as the height of the image stack and gain settings for each fluorophore were recorded a custom built macro then acquired all marked embryos 7 all three fluorophores sytox green coumarin and cy3 were excited simultaneously at seven hundred and fifty nm using a coherent chameleon 2photon laser at 47 power the emission was spectrally split into three channels 462502 nm coumarin 514543 nm sytox 599676 nm cy3 images were 10241024 and slices were taken every one m resulting image stacks were processed by previously described algorithms to unmix channels 56 and segment individual nuclei 6 resulting in individual pointcloud files for each embryo these were housed in a custombuilt database
 
gene expression atlases were assembled using the registration algorithms previously described in 7 for each species a morphological model was constructed that contained an average number of nuclei the 3d positions of the nuclei in the model were chosen to match the average egglength shape and density pattern measured for each of the six temporal cohorts motions of nuclei between time points in the model were constrained to be as small and smooth as possible while still recapitulating the observed changes in density and shape see 27 for details pointcloud data extracted for each embryo in a given cohort were aligned to the morphological template by a rigidbody transformation and isotropic scaling for each time point a registration template was constructed by finding average boundary locations of a registration marker gene eve or ftz with respect to the egglength of the morphological model fine registration of individual embryo pointclouds was then carried out by nonrigid warping of the embryo to align marker gene boundaries with the template finally expression values were computed for each nucleus and time point in the model by averaging measurements across those nuclei in individual pointclouds that were closest after spatial registration prior to averaging gains and offsets were estimated for expression measurements within each embryo pointcloud in order to minimize the expression variance across the cohort and to match smoothed estimates of the total change in expression level between temporal cohorts see 7 for details
 
surface area was computed as the sum of areas of the triangles defined by the neighbor relation information in the pointclouds 6 local density was computed by defining a disk of fifteen m radius on the surface around each nucleus and dividing the number of nuclei in this disk by its area 6 these density maps were then averaged over a cohort of embryos by resampling the cylindrical projections onto a regular grid
 
celltocell comparisons within and between species were made by looking at the squared distance between vectors of average expression measurements for the cell at all six time points and eleven genes for a pair of nuclei i and j we computed the distancewhere e i gt is the expression of the gth gene recorded in the atlas for the ith cell at time point t we used squared distance since it is additive across genes and timepoints which makes the contribution of individual genes more interpretable prior to computing the distance expression levels for each gene in the atlas were scaled so that the maximum expression at each time point was 10 in order to determine relevant cells to compare between species only cells that were nearby were considered corresponding locations were estimated by scaling each atlas to unit egg length and nearby nuclei were specified as those nuclei in the target embryo that were within the thirty nearest to the cell to be matched
 
since there are often several cells that are good matches the displacement direction to the best matching nearby cell is noisy in order to visualize displacement we used a weighted average of the locations of the top ten matching cells smallest expression distance the 3d locations of these ten matching cells were averaged using weights inversely proportional to the expression distance ie 1dij these 3d displacement vectors were then visualized on a cylindrical projection
 
we chose not to include bcd and cad in calculation of the expression distance score for the entire dataset we excluded bcd because its expression increases over the first two time points in the d melanogaster dataset this is likely an experimental artifact and leads to artificially high expression distance scores in the anterior we excluded cad because data was not available for d pseudoobscura and we wished to compare results between the d melanogasterd yakuba and d melanogasterd pseudoobscura analyses
 
as an alternative to expression distance scores we also considered a hypothesistesting framework in which two cells are declared to have different expression profiles if the expression of some gene at some time point is significantly different relative to variance in our measurements this comparison was carried out independently for each cell gene and timepoint using a twosample ttest with unequal sample sizes and variances in all tests we used the bonferroni correction to assure a familywise error rate of less than 001 visualizations and histograms in figures s5 and s9 show the number of expression profile measurements for which a given cell was significantly different under this significance threshold
 
we defined an expression neighborhood ni for a given nucleus i in the following way choose a threshold t and find all nuclei in the atlas for which dijt of these nuclei with similar spatiotemporal expression profiles let ni be the largest connected component on the embryo surface that contains cell i for areas where the expression pattern varies rapidly in space this neighborhood of similar cells is small in areas where the pattern changes slowly the neighborhood is large
 
to determine how these neighborhoods might expand or contract between different species we consider the neighborhood size around corresponding nuclei let j be the nucleus in the target atlas whose expression profile best matches i in the source atlas we compare the relative sizes of the two neighborhoods in order to gauge the degree of expansion or contraction measured by the log ratio of neighborhood sizes
 
the log ratio is symmetric about zero with positive values indicating an expansion and negative values indicating a contraction
 
one concern is that the choice of neighbor threshold may affect this analysis since there is not a meaningful way to scale the measured fluorescence levels between atlases of different species to resolve this we choose the threshold for each target atlas adaptively given a fixed threshold for the query atlas we searched over thresholds for the target atlas in order to find a threshold in which the average expansion ratio r across all cells matched the logratio of the number of nuclei in the two atlases choosing the threshold in this way entails that ratios are visualized relative to a null hypothesis of uniform scaling between species
 
figures similar to figure 5 figure 6 figure s4 figure s7 and figure s8 can easily be generated using multeesum a custom software tool for visualizing comparative analysis of cellular gene expression profiles 57 our datasets are complex and best viewed interactively we therefore have made multeesum and the analyses presented here available for download at  we have released multeesum open source and it was developed using the processing programming language  an opensource language for visualization executables for running on mac osx windows and linux and instructions see readmetxt are included in the download a full description of the usage and features of multeesum can be found at

to determine the best explanatory set of genetic variants while minimizing the number of comparisons in model selection we used stepaic procedure to build cox proportional hazards models for the aids1987 phenotype based on stepwise regression akaike information criteria aic and the best subset selection 69 here we used proc phreg in sas software with slentry  zero point nine nine and slstay  zero point nine nine five values chosen close to one to generate a sequence of models from null models to full model ordered by aic 48 model uncertainty caused by including large number of variables can be estimated by shrinkage lrplr where lr denotes the likelihood ratio  two and p denotes the number of the predictors in the final model a shrinkage below zero point eight five raises concern of overfitting 48 it is recommended that no more than m the number of uncensored event10 predictor degree of freedom p number of parameters should be examined to fit a multiple regression model as in our sample there were one hundred and ninetyfour events without censoring we expect that fitting with 19 variables would be appropriate 48
 
to control for potential population stratification we adjusted the regression analysis with eigenvector values 70 eigenvector values were obtained by performing principal component analysis of 700022 snps from a previous gwas study carried out in the same samples 71 in the cox regression analysis eigenvector values for the top two principle components were included as covariates the genomic inflation factor in this seroconverter population showed minimal systematic overall bias due to population structure in regards to disease progression phenotype as it was quite close to one point zero   101 expected under no population stratification 71

the creation of the nam population of ril families has been described previously 3 28 environments field design traits another publiclyavailable maize ril family the intermated b73bymo17 ibm family was also included in our analyses for a total of four thousand eight hundred and ninetytwo rils from twentysix biparental families with b73 as a common parent and a total of twentyseven parents all inflorescence traits were measured in eight environments including aurora ny clayton nc urbana il homestead fl and ponce pr in 2006 and aurora ny in two thousand and seven point tassel traits were additionally measured in columbia mo in two thousand and six and urbana il in two thousand and seven point ear traits were additionally measured in clayton nc in two thousand and seven and aurora ny in two thousand and eight point in each location each family was represented by two hundred and twenty rows two hundred rows of rils and ten rows of each parent data from some rils was later discarded to bring the total ril number to four thousand eight hundred and ninetytwo 28
 
trait transformations were performed using the boxcox function in r with lambda ranging from 10 to 10 in increments of 01 where lambda values of zero and one are equivalent to log and linear transformations respectively branch number and ear row number traits had maximum likelihood values of lambda of zero point three and zero point four respectively boxcox transformed values of these traits were used to calculate blups blups were calculated in sas using proc mixed and a model with location setlocation family familylocation and entryfamily as random effects
 
the genotypic dataset consisted of eight hundred and thirtysix markers representing the subset of one thousand one hundred and six markers that could be placed unambiguously on the physical map scored on four thousand eight hundred and ninetytwo rils missing data consisting primarily of markers that were noninformative in particular families were imputed as previously described 4 joint linkage models were obtained in sas using the stepwise selection procedure in proc glmselect the family term was forced into the model and each of the eight hundred and thirtysix possible markerbyfamily terms was made available for inclusion significance levels for entry and exit of model terms were determined by permutation phenotypic data were permuted against the genotypic data separately within each family all eight hundred and thirtysix markerbyfamily terms were tested and the lowest resulting pvalue was recorded for each permutation one thousand permutations were performed and alpha was set at 05
 
missing snp data from the maize hapmap project 29 were imputed as previously described 4 for nonrecombinant ril marker intervals snp values of zero common parent allele and one alternate allele were assigned according to the parental genotype for recombinant ril marker intervals snp values between zero and one were assigned based on the physical position of the snp within the interval and assuming a linear relationship between physical and genetic distance projection was also tested assuming a linear relationship between genespace and genetic distance but this had very little effect on the results gwas models were fit for each chromosome separately the phenotypes for each chromosome consisted of residuals from a joint linkage model excluding both the family covariate and all qtl on the chromosome under consideration gwas genotypes were obtained by scoring one point six million snps in the twentyseven parental lines and then projecting these genotypes into the progeny rils we employed a subsampling procedure wherein 80 of the rils from each family were sampled without replacement and forward regression was used to fit snps in the presence of the family term using permutationderived significance thresholds 4 this process was repeated one hundred times to obtain a resample model inclusion probability rmip value for each snp ranging from zero to 1 which represents the percentage of samples in which that snp was selected only snps with rmip values greater than or equal to zero point zero five were used for further analysis
 
qtl effects for each trait were divided by the standard deviation of blup values across a set of two hundred and eightytwo diverse maize lines that included the twentyseven parental lines and multiplied by the broadsense heritability estimate for that trait since a minimum of twentysix qtl were detected for each trait a 26qtl model was refit for each trait and used to determine effect sizes this experiment used a reference design 26 inbred lines were each crossed to a common parent meaning that qtl effect sizes are potentially biased for traits for which the common parent is an outlier to circumvent this problem for each qtl we calculated the predicted effects of all pairwise matings between the twentysix parents eg for two parents with effects of 1 and 1 relative to the common parent the predicted qtl effect size in this family is 2 yielding a total of three hundred and twentyfive 26 choose 2 effect sizes for each qtl or a total of six thousand eight hundred and twentyfive qtl effects per trait
 
pleiotropy between pairs of traits in the joint linkage analysis was evaluated as described previously 3 briefly the qtl model for each trait was applied to every other trait and correlations between effect estimates were used to detect significant pleiotropic qtl for each qtl in each pairwise trait comparison the pearson correlation coefficient r between the two effect vectors of length twentysix is significant at p001 if r exceeds zero point four nine five two tailed t distribution twentyfour df the percentage of shared qtl between two traits is the sum of two fractions the fraction of significant correlations when the model for trait one is applied to trait 2 and vice versa pleiotropy between pairs of traits in gwas analysis has not been reported previously first the effects of all gwas snps for each trait in each family were weighted by their rmip values and averaged in sliding windows across the genome in order to derive a vector of effect estimates for each trait in each window results presented here used a five cm window size and a two point five cm step but similar results were obtained for larger and smaller windows second for each pair of traits only windows where the sum of rmip values for each trait fell above a threshold rmip  zero point one zero for the results presented were considered finally significance of pearson correlation coefficients between effect estimates was calculated as for joint linkage analysis
 
we considered only the top ten gwas snps for each trait ordered by decreasing rmip value on the assumption that these more robustlyselected snps should be more closely linked to the causal variants to test for significant enrichment the number of highrmip snps for a given trait that fell within 05 1 and two cm of candidates was compared with a null distribution obtained by selecting an equivalent number of random genes eg seventeen random genes for comparison to seventeen sbp candidates calculating their proximity to trait snps and repeating this process one thousand times selection of random positions rather than random genes represents a far less stringent test since genes are clustered in the maize genome

s oneidensis mr1 was purchased from atcc catalog number 700550 e coli conjugation donor strain wm3064 was a gift of william metcalf u of illinois the e coli arge strain was obtained from the keio collection 11 see table s4 for the strains used in this study all strains were commonly cultured in luriabertani broth lb with appropriate antibiotic selection kanamycin 50 gml for mr1 transposon mutants and for the e coli arge strain and gentamicin 15 gml for complementation strains containing plasmid pbbr1mcs5 to grow the diaminopimelic acid dap auxotroph wm3064 dap was added to the media at a final concentration of three hundred m our standard mr1 minimal media contained salts per liter one point five g nh4cl zero point one g kcl one point seven five g nacl zero point six one g mgcl26h20 zero point six g nah2po4 thirty mm pipes buffer twenty mm dllactate wolfes vitamins and wolfes minerals for anaerobic minimal media we added one of the following electron acceptors fumarate 30 mm dimethyl sulfoxide 20 mm iron iii citrate 10 mm manganese iv oxide 30 mm trimethylamine noxide 10 mm nitrate 5 mm or cobalt iiiedta 5 mm for anaerobic experiments manganese oxide 72 and cobalt iiiedta 73 were prepared as described for pool experiments with alternative nutrient sources we replaced the dllactate with a different carbon source the nh4cl with a different nitrogen source both with a single carbonnitrogen source or the nah2po4 with an alternative phosphorous source for alternative sulfur sources we replaced all sulfate containing minerals in the wolfes mineral mixture with nonsulfur containing versions such that the added sulfur source served as the sole source mr1 was typically grown at 30c e coli was grown at 37c
 
we previously reported the generation and preliminary analysis of a library of 7387 transposon insertion mutants in mr1 19 to achieve greater coverage of the genome we mapped an additional 17301 mutants using a twostep arbitrary pcr and sequencing protocol as described 19 briefly each tagmodule contains two unique twenty bp dna sequences the uptag and downtag each flanked by common pcr priming sites the tagmodules are cloned into a gateway entry vector and can be readily transferred to any gateway compatible destination vector via the lr clonase reaction invitrogen we transferred the tagmodules into two different transposon vectors that are active in mr1 the tn5based prl27 74 and marinerbased pminihimarrb1 75 the tagged transposons were introduced into mr1 by conjugation with an e coli wm3064 donor strain carrying the appropriate suicide vector we used a twostep arbitrary pcr and sequencing protocol to simultaneously map the transposon insertion location and identify the tagmodule all mutants were stored as glycerol stocks in either 96well or 384well plates overall we observe transposon insertion biases both on the main five mb chromosome and on the one hundred and sixtyone kb megaplasmid figure s6 analysis of the insertion preferences for tn5 and mariner indicates that their insertion biases are not equal figure s7 thus illustrating the benefit of using multiple transposons to achieve maximal coverage additionally we observed a greater than 4fold increase in mapped megaplasmid insertions relative to the expectation based on size given that the megaplasmid appears to be equal in copy number to the main chromosome data not shown we speculate that the megaplasmid is more accessible to transposon mutagenesis the total mr1 transposon collection consists of 24688 archived strains and represents mutants in 3447 unique genes table s1 for full list
 
we constructed two mutant pools the uppool and dnpool by mixing equal volumes of overnight lb cultures for each strain these pools were designed such that each strains tagmodule is unique within that pool and to achieve maximal coverage of the genome the uppool contains 4058 strains whose tags are detected at a threshold 5 over background in representative start hybridizations conversely the dnpool has 3977 strains that meet the same detection criteria a total of one hundred and sixtyfive strains across both pools 2 of the overall number of strains that we attempted to pool were not detected at 5 over background and fitness values were not calculated for these strains the 2 undetected strains are primarily due to sample tracking errors slow growth of the mutant strain during the process of pool construction and mutations in the tagmodule data not shown taking into account only those strains that are detectable our two pools contain 5680 unique transposon mutants 2420 mutant strains are in both pools and represent transposon insertions in 3345 unique proteincoding genes for 1675 genes two or more independent mutants are contained in the pools figure s1 for most pooled fitness experiments we performed a single experiment on each of the uppool and dnpool
 
individual aliquots of each pool were frozen at 80c in glycerol 10 vv prior to initiating a pool experiment a single freezer aliquot of each pool was grown in lb aerobically at 30c to mid log phase od600  20 at this point we collected a sample 1109 cells that we term the start the start sample represents the time zero of the experiment and is the control experiment that we compare all of our growth conditions to the same recovered cells were typically used to inoculate the condition media at a starting od600 of zero point zero one or 002 for standard liquid media conditions we typically collected condition samples after the cultures reached saturated growth representing between three and nine population doublings some conditions such as lb reach a high density and have more population doublings than certain minimal media conditions such as butyrate as the sole source of carbon
 
liquid growth pool experiments were done in a number of formats aerobic minimal media experiments were done in ten ml volumes with shaking at two hundred rpm anaerobic experiments were conducted in hungate tubes with shaking at two hundred rpm anaerobic experiments were set up in an anaerobic chamber coy with a gas mix of 5 h2 10 co2 and 85 n2 certain stress experiments in lb were performed in one ml volumes in the wells of a 24well microplate for these experiments the microplate was grown in a tecan infinite f200 reader to measure the amount of growth inhibition caused by the stress our target stress concentration resulted in a 50 reduction of the growth rate
 
for swimming motility experiments we pipetted 1108 cells from the start culture into the matrix of an lb soft agar plate 025 wv agar and incubated the plate at 30c after one or two days we removed cells from the outer ring ie the motile cells using a sterile razor
 
for heat shock survival experiments we incubated the aliquots of the start cells in a 42c water bath for different amounts of time after incubation we used some of the cells for measuring viability by serial dilution and plating on lb the remainder of the cells was used to inoculate a fresh tube of lb that was grown overnight to avoid the possibility of detecting tags from dead cells the tags from the overnight sample were hybridized and used as a measure of cell survival after heat shock for cold survival experiments we used the same method as for heat shock except we incubated the cells at 4c rather than 42c we followed a similar method for stationary phase survival however in this instance we left the pools in lb at 30c for days after the cultures reached saturation again we used some of the cells for determining viability by plating on lb plates additional cells were used to inoculate fresh lb media the overnight growth of these fresh cultures was used for tag array hybridization and serve as a measure of mutant survival in stationary phase further details on the media used and the growth conditions for each of the one hundred and ninetyfive pool experiments are contained in table s3 plots showing the survival of mr1 cells after heat shock cold incubation and stationary phase are contained in figure s8
 
genomic dna was isolated from each sample using either the dneasy blood tissue kit with optional rnase treatment qiagen or with a qiaxtractor genomic dna robot qiagen approximately one hundred ng of genomic dna was used as a template to amplify the uptags from the uppool samples and the downtags from the dnpool samples using previously described primers and pcr conditions 55 we combined uptag and downtag pcr products 10 l of each and hybridized to a single genflex 16kv2 microarray affymetrix that contains the tag complement sequences microarrays were hybridized washed labeled and scanned as described 55
 
using affymetrix cel files as a starting point we first averaged the log2 intensities across the five replicate probes for each tag to obtain values for each uptag and downtag we computed the difference the log ratio between these values for the condition array and the start array to give a fitness value for each strain sometimes we used an average of start arrays from other experiments instead of hybridizing a start array from that actual experiment loglevels in these independent start experiments were highly correlated r  095 we removed strains with the lowest 2 of levels in this average start array from the analysis we normalized the fitness values for the strains so that the median fitness for each pool and for each chromosome the main chromosome and the megaplasmid was zero after this normalization some of our experiments showed significant effects based on which 96well plate the strain had been grown in while we were preparing our pools so for all experiments we also set the median fitness of each of these groups of ninetysix strains to zero see table s5 for all strain fitness data we computed fitness values for each gene by averaging the fitness values for all of the insertions in that gene if a gene had one or more good insertions an insertion within the central 580 portion of the gene then we used only those good insertions to compute the average see table s6 for all gene fitness data
 
to estimate the reliability of each fitness value we took advantage of our fourteen control experiments measurements of the start pools after independent recoveries from the freezer and the fact that we have more than one fitness measurement for most genes ie more than one strain or the single strain for the gene is in both pools we used an approach similar to that of efron et al 76 we first computed a tlike test statistic which was where x are the measurements for the gene  is their average n is the number of measurements and   medianstdx that is the median across all genes with more than one measurement of the standard deviation of that genes measurements we transformed our test statistic into z scores that follow a normal distribution in the absence of biological signal by using the control experiments we transformed the distribution separately for genes with 1 2 3 or   four measurements we used conditions that we had repeated to verify that these z scores were appropriate ie the rate of discordant outliers with high z values was about the same as expected by chance data not shown see table s7 for z score data
 
aerobic single strain growth assays were performed in 96well microplates in a tecan sunrise plate reader at 30c with readings every fifteen minutes anaerobic single strain growth assays were performed in a dtx880 plate reader beckman housed in an anaerobic chamber coy at 30c with readings every thirty minutes all microplate growth assays contained one hundred and fifty l per well at a starting od600 of 002 before all single strain growth assays we isolated a single colony of the mutant strain and confirmed the expected location of the transposon insertion by pcr with a transposon specific primer and a genome primer we calculated doubling times for growth curves using a logistic algorithm implemented in r to calculate the relative growth rate for transposon mutants in figure 1c we divided the doubling time of the transposon mutant by the doubling time of wildtype mr1 all single strain growth assays were performed a minimum of three times
 
we measured gene expression in wildtype mr1 and in single transposon mutant strains cells were harvested after rnaprotect treatment qiagen in either early exponential growth or one hour after transfer to an experimental media for the transfer experiments all cultures were initially cultured in dllactate minimal media to early exponential phase prior to transfer to the experimental media for all experiments we collected 2109 cells isolated total rna with a rneasy mini kit qiagen and synthesized alexa fluor five hundred and fiftyfive labeled cdna with the superscript plus indirect cdna labeling module invitrogen
 
labeled cdna was hybridized to custom nimblegen oligonucleotide microarrays according to the manufacturers instructions we used two gene expression microarray designs a 4plex microarray that allows hybridizing four samples to different regions of a single slide and also a 12plex microarray the 4plex microarray had 66228 probes which reduced to 61178 after removing potential crosshybridizing probes with blat or roughly fifteen probes per gene the 12plex microarray had 42598 probes which reduced to 40881 after removal of crosshybridizing probes after removing potential crosshybridizing probes we made the distribution of the condition match that of the control ie using quantile normalization used local regression lowess to eliminate any bias in the log2 ratio by probe intensity and set the median normalized log2 levels of the probes to zero separately for each scaffold the final log2 ratio for each gene was the average of these normalized values for its probes we removed values for genes with less than four measurements these data are available on microbesonline to verify the quality of each experiment we checked the correlation of log ratios between adjacent genes that are predicted to be in the same operon and the average absolute difference within these pairs most comparisons had operon correlations above 08 some experiments had lower correlations but also had low average differences indicating that the correlation was low because there was less biological signal to detect
 
to complement the mutant phenotypes of single transposon mutant strains we introduced an intact copy of the mutated gene on the broadrange plasmid pbbr1mcs5 which contains a gentamicin resistance marker 77 if possible we used the native promoter of the gene to drive expression otherwise we relied on the activity of the pbbr1mcs5 lac promoter to express the complementation gene the complementation plasmids were constructed with circular polymerase extension cloning cpec 78 using primers 5gctctagaactagtggatccccc n and 5 gatatcgaattcctgcagccc n where n represents genomespecific primer sequences used to amplify the gene from genomic dna the underlined regions represent sequences homologous to the pbbr1mcs5 backbone to prepare the vector for cpec we amplified pbbr1mcs5 with primers 5gggctgcaggaattcgatatc and 5 gggggatccactagttctagagc following amplification the template vector was digested with dpni all pcr and cpec reactions were performed with phusion high fidelity dna polymerase new england biolabs both the vector and insert were gel purified with the zymoclean gel recovery kit zymo research the cpec reaction consisted of fifty ng of linearized pbbr1mcs5 twentyfive ng of the complementation gene pcr product and was cycled with the following protocol initial denaturation for fifteen seconds at 98c four cycles of 98c for thirty seconds 55c for thirty seconds and 72c for three point five minutes and a final extension at 72c for three minutes the cpec reaction was transformed into chemically competent top10 cells invitrogen and plated on lb with gentamicin complementation constructs were sequenceverified with primers compforseq comprevseq and in some instances additional internal gene primers see table s8 for full list of primer sequences used in this study complementation plasmids were transformed into e coli donor strain wm3064 and delivered into mr1 via conjugation single mr1 colonies carrying the complementation plasmids were selected on lb plates with gentamicin and assayed for growth in a microplate format as described above see table s9 for full list of complementation plasmids used in this study
 
tigr roles and subroles are associated with some gene families in the tigrfam database 29 we obtained tigrfam assignments from microbesonline along with their associated roles and subroles to exclude functional assignments that were not specific we removed assignments without a subrole or that matched the strings unknown or other this left us with nine hundred and seventyeight assignments to predict the functional classification of genes from fitness andor expression data we used a standard implementation of random forests randomforest 4536 in r211 and default settings a random forest is a collection of decision trees each of which makes their own predictions the random forests prediction is that predicted by the largest number of decision trees and the confidence of the prediction is the proportion of trees in the forest that make that prediction before applying the random forest we subtracted the mean from each experiment and replaced missing values with zeroes to assess the predictions without being biased by the training data we used 10fold crossvalidation we trained the classifier on 90 of the genes with known subroles and then made predictions for the remaining 10 of the genes we repeated this ten times so that we had predictions for every gene because genes in the same operon tend to be functionally related we ensured that genes in the training set the 90 were not in the same operons as the genes we made predictions for

the mexican individuals analyzed in this project come from two sources a panel of four hundred and ninetytwo mexican parentoffspring trios recruited from mexico city as part of a previous genomewide association study mex1 14 and twentythree hapmap phase3 mexican trios recruited from los angeles california mex2  for estimating locusspecific ancestry we used the hapmap ceu n  88 and yri n  100 individuals for the ancestral populations to analyze the european component of the admixed genome we augmented the mexican datasets with individuals recruited from dublin ireland n  43 rome italy 45 warsaw poland n  45 and porto portugal n  43 for the indigenous american component analyses we combined the data generated in two previous studies 2 16 four mayan individuals with substantial european admixture are removed the combined set used for the subsequent analyses includes fourteen individuals from guerrero mexico two nahua seven mixtec and five tlapanec twentyfour mayan individuals from the yucatan peninsula twentyfour quechua collected in cerro de pasco peru twentyfive individuals of largely aymara ancestry collected in la paz bolivia thirteen karitiana and eight surui from brazil seven colombians and fourteen pima because the sample sizes for nahua mixtec and tlapnec are small and all individuals were recruited from the same state we considered these individuals as one group table s1 summarizes the individuals used for each analysis
 
genotyping and quality control procedures have been described in the primary publications for each dataset except for the dataset of one hundred and seventysix european individuals briefly mex1 and the hgdp individuals were genotyped on illumina 550k and on 650k beadchip respectively the indigenous american individuals from bigham et al 2009 were genotyped on affymetrix 1m snp arrays 16 the set of one hundred and seventysix european individuals were genotyped using illumina humanhap300 arrays this dataset originally included one hundred and eighty individuals four individuals were found with nonnegligible noneuropean ancestry and were excluded snps with a call rate of less than 95 were excluded the number of individuals and markers used for each analysis is summarized in table s1 we used beagle to construct haplotypes for mexican trios 34 as children provide no additional information regarding population structure or adaptation they are not used in subsequent analyses
 
continentallevel admixture proportions were estimated two ways 1 a modelbased clustering algorithm implemented in frappe 35 and 2 average locusspecific ancestries across all markers locusspecific ancestry was estimated with saber an extension of a previously described approach saber that uses a markovhidden markov model 12 saber differs from saber in implementation of a new algorithm an autoregressive hidden markov model arhmm in which haplotype structure within the ancestral populations is adaptively constructed using a binary decision tree based on as many as fifteen markers and which therefore does not require a priori knowledge of genomewide ancestry proportions johnson et al in preparation in simulation studies the arhmm achieves accuracy comparable to hapmix 36 but is more flexible in modeling the threeway admixture in the mexican population and does not require information about the recombination rate
 
hapmap ceu and yri individuals were used as the reference ancestral populations based on frappe and supported by pca fifty individuals in mex1 set have more than 95 indigenous american ancestry these individuals were initially used to approximate the indigenous american ancestors in the locusspecific ancestry analyses an iterative procedure is used to identify and correct for the nonindigenous american segments in these individuals accuracy of the locusspecific ancestry is verified by performing a pc analysis treating each individual as three nonadmixed genomes mexeur mexamr and mexafr see section subspace pca below
 
we implemented this algorithm to accommodate the large amount of missing genotype data in partially masked virtual genomes and used it to derive all the pca results reported here the statistical theory of the algorithm in a general data mining context can be found in 13 however various modifications are required for the current setting as described below let gh h  12 be two nm matrices in which denote the unordered pair of alleles at snp m m  1m in individual n n  1n the columns of gh are standardized to have mean zero and variance one point to compute the subspace spanned by the first k principal components pc we begin by finding a matrix decomposition  which minimizes the reconstruction error r defined assubject to the constraints that the column vectors of a are of unit norm and mutually orthogonal and the row vectors of s are also mutually orthogonal here a is a nd matrix s is a md matrix and dnm represents the desired number of leading pcs the algorithm we use is a generalized instance of the coordinate descent approach 37 which iteratively optimizes matrix a for fixed s and then optimizes s fixing a according to the rules where  is a learning rate the superscripts r indicate iteration and the subscripts j denote the jth column of a matrix it can be shown that the columns of a and s span the subspace of the first d pcs and that the leading pcs can be computed by orthogonalizing the columns of a and s 13 to evaluate the accuracy of our modified sspca approach we applied it in parallel with eigenstrat 21 to the intact mexican genomes and found the leading pcs produced by the two algorithms were virtually identical up to a permutation of signs
 
we carried out two simulation experiments to evaluate the impact of statistical uncertainties associated with estimating locusspecific ancestry and to investigate the performance of the sspca approach
 
in the first set of simulations we created ten datasets in which four hundred admixed genomes were modeled to mimic a latino population each individual draws chromosomal segments from european and indigenous american ancestry and the proportion of indigenous american ancestry in each individual matches what we observed in mex1 for two hundred individuals europeanderived segments were sampled from the hapmap ceu haplotypes representing northern and western european ancestry while for the remaining two hundred individuals the europeanderived segments were sampled from mexeur inferred from the actual mexican genotype data representing southern european ancestry the chromosomal segments from ceu and mexeur in the admixed individuals were treated as the true european virtual genomes
 
to evaluate the potential impact of statistical uncertainty we introduced random errors in which the true identities of european vs indigenous american segments were switched with probability  the top pc for each set of simulated virtual genomes at each of eight error rates   001020 was computed with sspca we evaluate the effect of these errors by calculating a confusion fraction  that quantifies the accuracy with which the estimated first pc separates individuals with northern vs southern european ancestry and is defined as the proportion of individuals that lie on the wrong side of a threshold that best separates the two groups thus  can range from zero perfect separation to nearly 50 complete confusion as would be observed for genetically homogenous groups finally we analyze each of the ten datasets using saber exactly as was done for real data apply sspca to estimate substructure and calculate a confusion fraction the results for this simulation experiment are depicted in figure s2 and show that the confusion fraction increases substantially from a mean of 214 to 175 at error rates between zero point zero three and 005 using saber on these same ten datasets yields a mean confusion fraction of 158 which corresponds to an error rate 002 indicated by the arrow in figure s2
 
in a second set of simulations to investigate the ability of the sspca approach to deal with missing data we created five datasets in which the proportion of genomewide european ancestry in each of four hundred admixed genomes was fixed at either 50 or 30 respectively applying saber and sspca to these datasets yields mean confusion fractions of zero and 07 respectively indicating that our approach performs well for situations such as the one described here where mean genomewide continental ancestry proportions are above 30 for both the european and the indigenous american components
 
we used the number of ancestry blocks in an individual as summary statistics tracing through a pedigree of t generations the expected number of recombination events in a haploid genome is 001tl where l is the total genome length taken to be 3435cm 38 under a hybridisolation model and assuming a genomewide ancestry proportion of z a fraction of 2z1z of the recombination events occurs between two haplotypes of opposite ancestry and thus leads to transitions in ancestry when we count the number of ancestry blocks in the real data we do not observe recombination events that occur between two haplotypes of the same ancestry hence the expected number of ancestry switches in a diploid genome is b  22001tlz1z and each ancestry switch creates one additional ancestry block when there is no ancestry switch in a genome the number of ancestry blocks is defined to be the same as the number of chromosomes therefore for each specific time of admixing t we computed the expected number of ancestry blocks as b222 with the genomewide ancestry proportion z varying from zero to one at one hundred equally spaced grid points each curve in figure 2d shows the expected number of ancestry blocks as a function of admixture proportions for a specific admixing time the estimated numbers of european and noneuropean ancestry blocks from the mexican individuals were tallied and compared to the expected values to assess the impact of uncertainty associated with estimating the number of ancestry blocks we note that errors in estimating locusspecific ancestry often create very short ancestry blocks hence we simulated admixed genomes according to the hybridisolation model but removed extremely short blocks segments with 10 snps from both simulated genomes and real data the estimated admixing time remained the same under this alternative analysis suggesting the estimated admixing time is relatively robust the hybridisolation model was chosen because of the mathematical simplicity under a more realistic continuous geneflow model the estimated times of admixing should be interpreted as an approximation of average admixing time weighted by the relative level of geneflow in each generation
 
to assess the subcontinental population structure each mexican genome was partitioned into three nonadmixed genomes by masking ie setting to missing alleles from all but one ancestral population in other words the european component of a mexicans genome mexeur was derived by treating as missing all alleles whose origins were inferred as african or indigenous american for within european analysis we applied sspca on the dataset consisting of mexeur including both mexico city and hapmap samples eightyeight hapmap ceu and one hundred and seventysix european individuals from four cities dublin ireland warsaw poland rome italy and porto portugal because of the limited number of informative haplotype segments mexican individuals with less than 25 european ancestry were excluded from this analysis in an analogous fashion we analyzed the mexican component of the genome mexamr along with one hundred and twentynine indigenous indigenous american individuals representing eight populations table s1 because the african ancestry is low in both mexican cohorts 3 and 5 respectively we did not analyze the withinafrica population structure
 
or all snps with frequencies between point zero five and point nine five in the respective populations ihs was calculated following voight et al 8 with two modifications first haplotype homozygosity scores for a core snp is computed on the subset of haplotypes in which the core snps are derived from a specific population if a haplotype is truncated because of an ancestry change the haplotype beyond the ancestry switch point is considered different from all other haplotypes in the corresponding interval we have also considered an alternative strategy in which only haplotypes that do not have an ancestry change within four hundred snps from the core snps are included in the calculation the results are virtually identical second instead of binning snps by the inferred ancestral allele frequencies and calculating the standard deviation of ihs in each bin we used a quantile regression to estimate the 25th and 75thpercentile of the empirical null distribution as a function of the minor allele frequency the raw ihs scores were then normalized by the estimated interquartile range within each chromosome the resulting standardized ihs scores fit a standard normal distribution well to define regions that may harbor recently adaptive alleles we seeded a region by a window of 50kb around a snp with extreme ihs scores we then successively scanned to the left and to the right 50kb a time merging neighboring regions in which at least one snps has an ihs25 which represents the 99thpercentile of the scores finally the top ten list in table one requires that at least 10 of the snps in the region have ihs25 the proportion of snps with high ihs was the criterion used by pickrell et al 9 it has been suggested that genomewide and locusspecific ancestries may show particular poor correlation at loci under selection compared to neutrally evolving loci 39 we did not observe such a trend at loci with the highest ihs scores in either mexamr or mexeur

all individuals studied and all analyses on their samples were done according to the declaration of helsinki and informed consents were approved by the local ethics committee for the istituto di ricerca genetica e biomedicacnr irgbcnr cagliari italy and by medstar research institute responsible for intramural research at the national institutes of aging baltimore maryland united states
 
we recruited and phenotyped 6148 individuals males and females ages 14102 y from a cluster of four towns in the lanusei valley of sardinia 11 during physical examination a blood sample was collected from each individual and divided into two aliquots one aliquot was used for dna extraction and the other to characterize several blood phenotypes including evaluation of serum levels of hscrp il6 mcp1 and values of esr descriptive statistics of the study cohort are shown in table s2 serum levels of hscrp were measured by the high sensitivity vermont assay university of vermont burlington an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay calibrated with who reference material 55 the lower detection limit of this assay is zero point zero zero seven mgl with an interassay coefficient of variation of 514 serum levels of il6 and mcp1 were measured by quantikine high sensitive human immunoassays rd systems inc according to manufacturers instructions this method employs solidphase elisa techniques for il6 the lower detection limit is zero point zero three nine pgml the intraassay coefficient of variations cvs were 69 to 78 over the range 043553 pgml for mcp1 the lower detection limit is five point zero pgml the intraassay coefficient of variations cvs were 47 to 78 over the range 7671121 pgml esr was measured using sedimentation measurement tubes buffered with 38 sodium citrate venojectterumo after mixing of two point four ml of blood with the additive tubes were left in a vertical position in the specific support with graduation markings for thirty minutes to allow sedimentation of the erythrocytes by gravity the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is calculated in westergreen units mmh determining the length at the plasmaerythrocyte cell interface level within the sedimentation tube samples affected by multiple sclerosis ms and type one diabetes t1d used for the side casecontrol analysis briefly reported in the discussion were recruited from all the island as previously described 51 only twenty of these samples overlapped with those in the sardinia cohort
 
during the study we genotyped 4694 individuals selected from the whole sample to represent the largest available families regardless of their phenotypic values specifically 1412 were genotyped with the five hundred k affymetrix mapping array set 3329 with the ten k mapping array set with four hundred and thirtysix individuals genotyped with both arrays we also recently typed 1097 individuals with the affymetrix six point zero chip of which 1004 and sixtysix were also typed with the ten k and five hundred k chips respectively this genotyping strategy allowed us to examine the majority of our cohort in a costeffective manner since genotypes for the snps that passed quality control checks could be propagated through the pedigree using imputation measurements of inflammatory biomarkers were available for 4137 4292 4295 and 3596 individuals for hscrp il6 mcp1 and esr respectively among the 4694 genotyped a total of 731209 autosomal snps passed stringent quality control checks quality checks for the ten k and five hundred k chips were described previously 56 for the affymetrix six point zero chip similar criteria were used as detailed in table s3 in addition we also removed snps in common between the other chips that showed an high level of discordance or that generated too many discrepancies when comparing genotypes across eleven duplicates after performing quality control checks and merging genotypes from the three gene chip platforms we used the quality controlled 731209 autosomal markers to estimate genotypes for all polymorphic snps in the ceu hapmap population release 22 57 in the individuals genotyped with the five hundred k array and the six point zero affymetrix chip separately using the mach software 58 taking advantage of the relatedness among individuals in the sardinia sample we carried out a second round of computational analysis to impute genotypes at all snps in the individuals who were genotyped only with the affymetrix mapping ten k array being mostly offspring and siblings of the individuals genotyped at high density at this second round of imputation we focused on the snps for which the imputation procedure predicted r2030 between true and imputed genotypes and for which the inferred genotype did not generate an excess of mendelian errors we then used a modified version of the landergreen algorithm as previously described 3 56 to estimate ibd sharing at the location of the snps being tested and identify stretches of haplotype shared with close relatives who were genotyped at higher density and probabilistically infer missing genotypes the withinfamily imputation procedure and the association test are implemented in merlin software 59 60 due to computational constraints we divided large pedigrees into subunits with bitcomplexity of twentyone or less typically 2530 individuals before analysis
 
for association we evaluated the additive effect of genotyped and imputed snps on inflammatory biomarker levels using a familybased association test implemented in merlin fastassoc option 59 60 this test accounts for relatedness under the assumption that the samples analyzed are from an ethnically homogeneous population 59 60 and this is suggested by demographic records indicating that 89 of the participants were born in the same thirtyone km2 area and for 95 of the volunteers both parents and all grandparents were born in sardinia 11 at each snp levels of each biomarker of inflammation were regressed onto allele counts in a regression model that included gender age and agesquared as covariates we also used a second model which included bodymass index bmi and smoking status as additional covariates as these have been previously implicated as being associated with inflammatory biomarker levels 24 here we report the results from the second model where the inclusion of the additional covariates improved the variance explained by the model from 18 to 37 for crp from 181 to 195 for esr from 68 to 76 for il6 and from 3 to 33 for mcp1 genomic control parameters show negligible inflation 1049 1039 one point zero three one and 1115 respectively for hscrp mcp1 il6 and esr nevertheless the corresponding correction factors were applied to the gwas results to completely avoid spurious associations
 
the sardinia stage two cohort was used to followup initial findings 27 genotyping of specific snps was performed in sardinian individuals selected for replication efforts using taqman single snp genotyping assays applied biosystems in particular we genotyped and analysed 1392 individuals from the sardinia stage two cohort who were unrelated kinship coefficient  0 to the individuals analysed in the gwas
 
we successfully genotyped 6145 samples using the metabochip and immunochip arrays illumina the metabochip was designed in collaboration with several international consortia 3 61 62 with the aim to fine map association loci detected through gwas for a variety of traits part of the design included a set of wildcard snps chosen by individual research groups the sardinia study promoted several snps associated with a wide range of traits including rs12075 the immunochip is also a consortium based array designed to fine map loci associated to twelve immunologically related human diseases or immunemediated disease loci as well as a set of wildcard snps the sardinia study had not role in the design of this array and a full detailed description is provided elsewhere 12 all samples had a genotyping call rate 98 and snp genotypes were carefully assessed though several quality control checks in particular we removed markers with call rate 98 with strong deviation from hwe p106 that were monomorphic or leading to an excess of mendelian errors defined as 1 of the families a detailed breakdown of markers excluded by each filter criteria is provided on table s4 since the majority of the variants included on these custom arrays are of low frequency compared to the gwas data set average maf  0176 compared to zero point two one nine observed in gwas the impact of hidden population structure and imprecise modelling of relatedness due to pedigree splitting task we performed on the gwas data set due to computational constraints could be problematic analysis was thus carried out using emmax a variant component model that overcomes such issues by using a genomicbased kinship matrix 63 to calculate the kinship matrix we used all snps that passed quality control checks but excluding those with maf between zero and 1 association analysis was subsequently performed testing all qced snps table s4 in spite of their minor allele frequency observed genomic lambda were 101 0962 one point zero zero and 101 respectively for il6 ves mcp1 and hscrp as a note genomic lambda using merlin on the same data set were 141 1 one point two six and 114 respectively to declare an association significant we used a bonferroni threshold of 005293875  17107
 
the variance explained by the strongest associated snps was calculated for each trait as the difference of r2 adjusted observed in the full and the basic models where the full model contains all the independent snps in addition to the covariates
 
we performed conditional analysis at each locus by adding the top associated snp to the already included covariates and testing for association the remaining snps at the locus a marker was declared independent only if the pvalue observed in the conditional analysis reached genomewide significance threshold 51008 in the step1 gwas and 171007 in the customarray based dataset 64

the two strains of c amylolentus cbs6039 and cbs6273 and the one t wingfieldii isolate cbs7118 were obtained from the centraalbureau voor schimmelcultures cbs fungal biodiversity centre in the netherlands both cbs6039 and cbs6273 were originally isolated from insect frass in south africa while cbs7118 was originally isolated from rubber sheet in indonesia all species were grown and maintained on yeast extractpeptonedextrose ypd medium at 24c mating assays were performed on v8 medium ph  five in the dark and also at 24c random spore dissection was performed on ypd medium as previously described 44 spore chain dissection was performed by first transferring a well separated spore chain onto a drop of zymolyase on ypd and after incubation at 24c for fifteen minutes individual spore from the spore chain was dissected as previously described 44
 
to isolate genomic dna from t wingfieldii and c amylolentus cells were cultured in fifty ml of liquid ypd shaking overnight at 24c the pellets were then lyophilized overnight and the ctab method of fungal dna isolation was performed as described before 24 plasmid dna from positive topo clones was extracted using the qiaprep spin miniprep kit qiagen valencia ca fosmid dna was isolated using a modified miniprep protocol and dna from the shotgun sequencing libraries was extracted using the directprep96 miniprep kit qiagen valencia ca additionally progeny dna was isolated using a modified miniprep protocol and colony lifts were performed to isolate dna from individual colonies in each fosmid library according to the protocol described in 28
 
we designed degenerate pcr primers using the online computer program consensusdegenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer codehop  to identify mat specific genes in t wingfieldii the primers consist of a relatively short 3 degenerate core and a longer 5 nondegenerate consensus clamp designed by multiple sequence alignments 48 we aligned sequences for two flanking genes fao1 and nog2 and two recently acquired mat genes rpo41 and lpd1 from c neoformans var neoformans and var grubii c gattii u maydis and c cinerea to design the degenerate pcr primers see table s4 for primer information pcr was performed on genomic dna isolated by the ctab extraction method as template and products were separated by gel electrophoresis products with the strongest ethidium bromidestaining signal were then gel extracted using the qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen valencia ca followed by transformation into e coli using the topota cloning kit invitrogen carlsbad ca plasmid dna was purified from transformants and then sequenced for c amylolentus degenerate primers were not used instead primers from t wingfieldii were directly used to amplify myo2 lpd1 sxi1 and sxi2 in both c amylolentus strains see table s4 for primer information
 
we employed the copycontrol fosmid library production kit epicentre madison wi to generate fosmid libraries for t wingfieldii and c amylolentus strain cbs6039 at least two point five g of ctab isolated genomic dna was randomly sheared using a two hundred l small bore pipette tip and sheared dna was endrepair converted to blunt 5 phosphorylated ends using endrepair enzyme mix dntps and atp we then separated the endrepaired dna overnight using a contourclamped homogenous electric field chef on a chef drii apparatus biorad hercules ca the following conditions were used 1 to 6second switch time six vcm 14c for 1415 hrs in 05x tbe the sizefractionated dna twentyfive to forty kb fragments was recovered by gel extraction and the dna was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol the precipitated insert dna was then ligated into the copycontrol pcc1fos cloningready vector and incubated overnight at 24c the ligated dna was packaged in phage particles and plated on e coli phageresistant cells epi100t1r plating strain overnight at 37c detailed protocol can found at  approximately 16000 fosmid clones were picked into 96well plates and transferred to 384well plates for longterm storage at 80c the 384well plates were replicated onto highdensity filters for hybridizations using the mat genes
 
positive fosmid clones were sequenced using the shotgun sequencing method described by metin et al 24 six fosmids were pooled and sequenced to generate the assembly for t wingfieldii and four fosmids were individually sequenced to generate the assembly for c amylolentus strain cbs6039 sequencing reactions were performed using big dye chemistry v31 applied biosystems foster city california united states and analyzed on an applied biosystems 3730xl capillary sequencer in the biological sciences sequencing facility at duke university for each library approximately 1200 sequence reads were imported into unix using phred and phrap to assemble the sequences into larger contigs of overlapping sequence 49 50 51 to close gaps in the assemblies we designed primers from contig ends using primer three  the genbank accession numbers for t wingfieldii are hm368525 hd locus and hm368524 pr locus the genbank accession numbers for the hd locus and the three pr contigs in c amylolentus cbs6039 are hm640220 hd locus hm640221 rpl39myo2 hm640222 lpd1ste12 and hm640223 gef1mfa the genbank accession numbers for genes from c amylolentus cbs6273 are hm640224 sxi1 hm640225 sxi2 hm640226 gef1 hm640227 lpd1 and hm640228 etf1
 
to determine the ploidy of the two c amylolentus and one t wingfieldii strains we cultured the isolates on ypd medium for two days at 24c each isolate was processed for flow cytometry as previously described 5 52 and analyzed using the fl1 channel on a bectondickinson facscan the 20 mb genome of c neoformansgattii was used as a reference for ploidy determination including haploid and diploid controls
 
to isolate chromosomal dna of c amylolentus and t wingfieldii spheroplasts were generated following the spheroplasting protocol for c neoformans and c gattii 53 the plugs containing spheroplasts were lysed at 55c for at least twentyfour hrs in lysing solution 05 m edta10 mm triscl ph  10 and 1 sarcosyl and then loaded onto a pfge apparatus and separated for approximately five days on a chef drii apparatus biorad hercules ca the following conditions were used block 1 75 to 150second switch time four vcm 13c for thirty hrs and block 2 two hundred to 400second switch time four vcm 13c for sixty hrs in 05x tbe the gel was then stained in ethidium bromide for fifteen minutes destained for an hour and visualized using a uv lamp the chromosomal dna was blotted overnight onto hybond amersham piscataway nj membranes in 20x ssc using standard protocols the membrane was then hybridized to mat gene probes generated by pcr we also performed southern blot analysis on genomic dna from c amylolentus that was digested with ecorv psti bamhi or noti the digested dna was separated on an agarose gel and probed with the rpl22 gene probe amplified from c amylolentus with primers designed for t wingfieldii see table s4 for primer information
 
we compared sequences from the hd locus of t wingfieldii to those of c amylolentus by employing a matrix comparison or dot plot analysis to generate each dot plot we employed the molecular toolkits online nucleic acid dot plots program  the parameters for the dot plot analyses were as follows the window size was fiftyone and the mismatch limit was six point we also employed the bioinformatic software artemis comparison tool release eight  to generate comparison plots across mat of t wingfieldii to c amylolentus and both sibling species compared to c neoformans serotype d strain jec21 54 the input file was created using webact  with the blastn algorithm 55

the genotyping protocol for stage i has been described previously 8 briefly the initial three hundred subjects were genotyped using the affymetrix genechip mapping 500k array set the remaining 4985 subjects were genotyped using the affymetrix genomewide human snp array 60 we included one negative control and at least three positive quality control qc samples from the coriell cell repositories  in each of the 96well plates for affymetrix snp array six point zero genotyping a total of two hundred and seventythree positive qc samples were successfully genotyped and the average concordance rate was 999 with a median value of 100 the sex of all study samples was confirmed to be female genetically identical unexpected duplicated samples were excluded as were close relatives with a pairwise proportion of identifybydescent ibd estimate greater than 025 all samples with a call rate95 were excluded the snps were excluded if i maf1 ii call rate95 or iii genotyping concordance rate95 in quality control samples the final dataset included 2918 cases and 2324 controls for 690947 markers there are 21223 snps that were on affymetrix 500k array set but not on the affymetrix snp array 60 these snps were excluded snps on the affymetrix six point zero array but not on the affymetrix 500k array were treated as missing data for those samples genotyped on using the affymetrix 500k array similar results were obtained after excluding women genotyped by affymetrix 500k array set from the analyses
 
genotyping for stage iia was completed using the illumina iselect platform to compare the consistency between the affymetrix and illumina iselect platforms we also included fortythree samples from stage i that were genotyped by affymetrix snp 60 similar to the qc procedures used in stage i the following criteria were used to exclude samples i call rate95 or ii unexpected duplicated samples based on ibd estimate snps were excluded if i call rate95 or ii genotyping concordance rate95 in quality control samples when compared with affymetrix six point zero data after qc the mean concordance rate was 9985 between illumina iselect and affymetrix six point zero genotyping
 
data for the snps analyzed in stage iib were extracted from the korean gwas genotyped using the affymetrix genomewide human snp array six point zero chip a total of thirty qc samples were successfully genotyped and the concordance rate was 9983 the sex of all samples was confirmed to be female the snps were excluded if 1 genotype call rate95 2 maf1 in either the cases or controls 3 deviation from hwe at pvalue106 and 4 poor cluster plot in either the cases or controls
 
genotyping for stage iii and all samples from koreans in stage iv was completed using the iplex sequenom massarray platform in the vanderbilt molecular epidemiology laboratory included in each 96well plate as qc samples were one negative control water two blinded duplicates and two samples from the hapmap project to compare the consistency between the affymetrix and sequenom platforms we also genotyped fortyfive samples included in stage i the mean concordance rate was 9967 for the blind duplicates 9888 for hapmap samples and 9952 between sequenom and affymetrix six point zero genotyping data quality from the hong kong study was low and thus data from the study were excluded for the current analysis genotyping for two chinese studies nanjing and guangzhou in stage iv was completed using the iplex sequenom massarray platform at the fudan university shanghai china blind duplicate qc samples were included and the mean concordance rate was 9870 genotyping for the tianjin study in stage iv was performed using taqman assays genotyping assay protocols were developed and validated at the vanderbilt molecular epidemiology laboratory and taqman genotyping assay reagents were provided to investigators of the tianjin study tianjin cancer institute and hospital for the mec study data for the three snps presented in this study were extracted from the gwa scan data generated using illumina 660w for snps not included on the chip imputed data using hapmap as reference were extracted genotype frequencies for snp rs9485372 deviated from hwe in controls p  0004 therefore this snp was excluded in data analyses not all snps for stage iv were genotyped in all studies included in stage iv due to genotyping failure or the use of different genotyping platforms table s8
 
snp selection for stage ii replication promising snps were selected for replication in stage ii based on the following criteria 1 minor allele frequency maf5 2 p002 in stage i 3 hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe test p10106 in controls 4 not in strong linkage disequilibrium ld r205 with any of the previously confirmed breast cancer genetic risk variants or snps evaluated in our previous studies 8 12 and 5 high genotyping quality as indicated by very clear genotyping clusters checked manually when multiple snps are in ld with r205 one snp with the lowest pvalue was selected in total 6303 snps were selected for replication a total of 5906 snps 937 were successfully designed by illumina and included in the iselect array after stringent qc procedures data from 5365 snps were considered high quality for association analyses in stage iia which include 1613 breast cancer patients and 1800 controls recruited from shanghai studies
 
snp selection for stage iii replication among the 5365 snps successfully genotyped in stage iia sixtyeight snps were selected for stage iii replication in an independent set of 5203 cases and 5138 controls recruited from shanghai and several other east asian populations table one and text s1 the selection criteria are 1 an association with breast cancer risk in stage iia with p005 2 the direction of the association consistent in both stages and 3 p0001 in the merged data of stage i and iia during the course of stage iii genotyping genomewide association scan data from 2359 cases and 2052 controls were obtained from the seoul breast cancer gwas stage iib therefore we performed a metaanalysis of stage iia and iib data of the 5297 snps which were not selected initially for stage iii replication based on stage iia data alone data were available for 4913 snps in stage iib metaanalyses of these 4913 snps from stage iia and iib yielded twentysix additional snps that showed an association at p005 and in the same direction among stages i iia and iib these twentysix snps were then added to the list of snps to be genotyped in stage iii
 
snp selection for stage iv replication based on the results of the first three stages twentytwo top snps were selected for stage iv evaluation and genotyped in up to 17423 additional subjects 7489 cases and 9934 controls table one and text s1
 
casecontrol differences in selected demographic characteristics and major risk factors were evaluated using ttests for continuous variables and chisquare tests for categorical variables associations between snps and breast cancer risk were assessed using odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis derived from logistic regression models ors were estimated for heterozygote and homozygote for the variant allele compared with homozygotes for the common allele ors were also estimated for the variant allele based on a logadditive model and adjusted for age and study site when appropriate stratified analyses by ethnicity menopausal status and estrogen receptor er status were carried out plink version one point zero six was used to analyze genomewide data obtained in stage i and the replication data in stage iia results from stage iib were also obtained from plink version 106 metaanalyses of stage iia and stage iib were performed using a weighted zstatistics method where weights were proportional to the square root of the number of individuals in each sample and standardized such that the weights added up to one the zstatistic summarizes the magnitude and direction of the effect relative to the reference allele an overall zstatistic and p value were then calculated from the weighted average of the individual statistics calculations were implemented in the metal package  individual data were obtained from each study for stage iv snps for a pooled analysis which were conducted using sas version 92 with the use of twotailed tests
 
we first investigated the population structure by estimating inflation factor  using all 690947 snps snps that passed the qc the inflation factor  was estimated to be 1042 suggesting that any population substructure if present should not have any appreciable effect on the results among the final 690947 snps obtained in stage i after qc we generated a list of 196471 snps with pairwise ld02 by using plink  then principal components were estimated based on these 196471 snps using eigenstrat 36 we then drew a plot for all stage i and hapmap ii subjects based on the first two principal components figure 4 all study participants in stage i were clustered very closely with hapmap asians the first five or ten principal components were adjusted in the logistic regression analyses for evaluating associations of snps and breast cancer risk
 
a all individuals from stage i and hapmap b breast cancer cases and controls from stage i
 
to evaluate the combined effect of snps located in chromosome 6q251 on breast cancer risk we created a genetic risk score grs by summing the number 02 of risk alleles that each woman carried for each of the three snps including rs9383951 rs9485372 rs2046210 the grs was constructed among those who had complete data for all three snps we also did imputation using mach  with hapmap ii asian data as reference ld structure was estimated from the flanking one hundred kb of these three snps and the esr1 gene using data from hapmap ii asians figure s1 all snps in the ld blocks including rs9485372 rs2046210 and rs9383951 and snps inside the esr1 gene were analyzed in relation to breast cancer risk with age rs9485372 rs9383951 and rs2046210 adjusted

embryo rnai was performed as previously described 22 using snapdragon  two independent gene segments for synthesis of org1 doublestranded rna dsrna were selected with lengths of five hundred and seventy and four hundred and seventythree bp and with less than twenty and twentytwo bp of identity to any other predicted gene respectively these segments of the org1 gene were pcramplified from primary embryonic cdna using the primers cgtccaaaaagttcaaggga and gctcgttctcatccaaggag 570 bp and gctccaacagagccagaatc and ccgaaccgtaaaaacttgga 473 bp and transcribed in vitro using the megascript rnai kit ambion usa lblgfp slougfp or mhctaugfp embryos were dechorionated and injected with negative control lacz or org1 dsrna at the syncytial blastoderm stage and allowed to develop to stage fourteen or sixteen before examination by fluorescence microscopy for assessment of reporter gfp expression a similar protocol was used to assess the function of acj6 in ndggfp embryos
 
the sixteen sequences in the training set of drosophila melanogaster fc enhancers range in length from three hundred and eleven to two thousand and sixtyeight bp average length one thousand two hundred and thirtytwo bp in gccontent from 39 to 49 average gccontent 43 and in repeatcontent from 0 to 7 average 15 the twentyfour orthologs have similar characteristics with an average length of one thousand three hundred and eleven bp gccontent of 43 and repeat content of 5 the control set comprised one thousand randomly selected d melanogaster noncoding genomic sequences with length gc and repeatcontent matching those of the enhancer set
 
putative tfbss were identified by searching the sequences with mast 118 for motifs in transfac release two thousand and nine point two 119 in addition to binding sequences for tin twi and pnt from the literature 5 mast was run independently on each individual sequence with default setup and parameters in particular for the final analysis of the tfbs composition of fc enhancers we examined the sequences for the occurrence of eleven types of tfbss pouhd voct01 vpou1f1q6 voct402 tbx vtbx501 ibynq6 myb vmybq6 fkh vfoxo301 vfoxo1q5 vfreac201 hd iabdaq6 vcdx5q5 vifp03 vpax402 and mef2 vamef2q6 vhmef2q6 and binding sites for tcf mad ets twi tin 5 since the position weight matrices pwms for tcf mad ets twi and tin were constructed from only a small number of sequences and we obtained few significant matches using mast we reinspected the sequences manually searching for the known binding sites of these tfs
 
overrepresented tfbss were determined by comparing the occurrence of the motifs among query sequences and background genomic sequence and applying fishers exact test we used a pvalue threshold of 005 when indicated we adjusted the pvalues for multiple testing using the procedure suggested by benjamini and hochberg 120
 
each nucleotide sequence in the fc enhancer and control sets was represented by the number of putative tfbss per base pair putative tfbss were identified by searching the sequences for motifs derived from three different sources 1 eight hundred and ninetytwo tf binding specificities characterized in transfac 2 three binding sequences for tin twi and pnt from the literature 5 and 3 at most fifty motifs that priority 51 found to be overrepresented in the training set of fc enhancers in order to prevent the overrepresentation of motifs in d melanogaster enhancer sequences with a large number of orthologs de novo motifs were identified on a restricted set of thirtyfour sequences including at most two randomly selected orthologs for each d melanogaster fc enhancer features relevant for distinguishing between enhancer sequences and controls were identified using linear support vector machine svm we used a standard tenfold crossvalidation procedure to assess the accuracy of the classifier in each fold of the crossvalidation procedure the de novo motifs were extracted using the training data only thereby ensuring that the test data were completely unseen before the predictions were made the crossvalidation procedure should help to prevent overfitting of the classifier
 
we used support vector machines 121 with a linear kernel which only requires setting the penalization coefficient c the performance of the svm was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve which yields values between zero point five for a completely random guess and one point zero for a perfect classifier in order to compensate for the data unbalance fc enhancer sequences and controls were assigned different misclassification costs svm softmargin constants giving equal overall weight to each class
 
given a training set of instances x1  xl with associated labels y1  yl  linear svm solves the optimization problem subject to and 122 thus after obtaining a linear svm model the weight vector w can be used to decide the relevance of each feature 123 the larger  the more important role of feature j in the decision function we rank featuresin our case motifsaccording to  for this purpose we trained a classifier for one hundred random partitions of the training data containing two thirds of the total training data computed the ranking for each feature and finally ranked the features according to their median ranking
 
we scanned the wholegenome of d melanogaster bdgp release five assembly with a sliding window of length one thousand base pairs and overlaps of five hundred base pairs the length of the window corresponds approximately to the average length of the sequences in the training data set 1280 base pairs we scored 137364 sequences after excluding sequences which overlap annotated coding regions by at least 50 the cutoff for the genome scan was defined to obtain a false positive rate fpr of at most 5 by training and testing one hundred classifiers on random partitions of the training data containing two thirds of the total training data
 
tf annotation for pwms was obtained from transfac and the broad institute msigdb database 124
 
to understand the effects of a sample size on the classifier performances we first extracted a dataset of drosophila melanogaster sixtytwo enhancers active in mesoderm from the redfly database 32 redfly contains one hundred and seventysix partially overlapping enhancers active in mesoderm to eliminate this redundancy we clustered together overlapping sequences and subsequently selected the shortest enhancer sequence from each cluster sequences longer than two kb as well as sequences overlapping our dataset of enhancers active in muscle founder were excluded from the final dataset orthologs were selected randomly among sequences from fifteen insect species 125 with nucleotide identity ranging from fifty to 80 so that at most two orthologs were selected for each drosophila melanogaster enhancer in redfly as controls we randomly sampled for each enhancer and orthologs ten noncoding sequences from the drosophila melanogaster genome with similar length gc and repeatcontent
 
each nucleotide sequence in the enhancer and control sets was represented by the number of putative tfbss per base pair putative tfbss were identified by searching the sequences with mast 118 for motifs derived from two sources 1 eight hundred and ninetytwo tf binding specificities characterized in transfac release two thousand and nine point two 119 and 2 three binding sequences for tin twi and pnt from the literature 5 features relevant for distinguishing between enhancer sequences and controls were identified using linear svm

subjects representing the three main continental ancestral groups making up modern latin american populations were obtained from a variety of sources hapmap phase iii genotype data for african and european populations was downloaded for this project including west african yoruba in ibadan nigeria yri and east african luhya in webuye kenya lwk as well as northern european utah residents with ancestry from northern and western europe ceu and southern european toscani in italy tsi individuals 47 48 for populations including parentchild trios or duos ceu yri only genotypes from the parents were used in addition known cryptically related individuals were removed 49 genotyping data for europeans was further supplemented by a cohort of six hundred and nineteen samples of spanish individuals genotyped on the affymetrix snp six point zero platform
 
one hundred and thirtyone native american subjects from mesoamerica nahua from central mexico n  14 zapotecas from oaxaca mexico n  21 and maya from campeche n  25 16 30 50 from the sierra madre occidental region tepehuanos from durango in northern mexico n  22 and south america aymara from la paz bolivia n  25 and quechua from cerro de pasco peru n  24 14 51 were used to determine native american allele frequencies these populations were genotyped either on the affymetrix snp six point zero or on two platforms the affymetrix snp 500k and the illumina five hundred and fifty point
 
a summary of the populations used for this study and genotyping platforms is given in table five point although additional native american subjects with genomewide data are available from the human genome diversity panel these subjects were genotyped on the illumina humanhap 650k and the intersection with the genotyping platforms used in our samples would have left fewer markers to be evaluated
 
four major quality control tests were performed on the data using the program plink 52 individuals were excluded if they had greater than 10 missing alleles if they were known to be related or showed cryptic relatedness for native american populations pairwise individuals were considered to have cryptic relatedness if their ibs scores showed a z1015 or a z2003 or if they had a proportion ibd pi hat008 53 europeans and african individuals were considered cryptically related if they had a z1003 or z2003 or if they had a proportion ibd003 snps were included if the genotyping rate was greater than 90 and excluded if they failed a 2 test for hardyweinberg equilibrium at a significance threshold of 105
 
markers representing the intersection of the genotyping platforms used to genotype the ancestral populations which met quality control criteria n  319665 were used as a basis for selecting aims figure five summarizes the methodology used to select aims for each snp for each ancestral group allele frequency was calculated with the program plink 52 for each marker statistics of informativeness including delta fst 54 and rosenbergs informativeness for assignment statistic in 55 were calculated between each pair of ancestral populations africaneuropean europeannative american and africannative american based on reference allele frequencies locus specific branch length lsbl 56 statistics were created for each population and each statistic of informativeness to translate the pairwise metrics into a populationspecific statistic a balanced set of aims was selected by ensuring that the cumulative lsbl for each population was approximately equal at each stage we selected the polymorphism with the highest lsbl for the population with the lowest cumulative lsbl that met the inclusion criteria polymorphisms were excluded if they were in linkage disequilibrium r201 or within a predefined physical distance 500 kb pairs of previously selected aims this ensures maximum independent informativeness and that the aims were well distributed throughout the genome in addition in order for potential aims to be applicable to all subpopulations within a continental group potential aims were also excluded if there was evidence of significant allele frequency heterogeneity between the samples representing each ancestral group 2 pvalue001 a script in the python programming language that implements this algorithm and ancestral population allele frequency data are available for download
 
in order to validate the panel of aims estimates of ancestry using the panel were compared to estimates of ancestry using genomewide data four admixed samples were used for validation the first two datasets were parents of puerto rican and mexican subjects with asthma genotyped on the affymetrix six point zero genechip as part of the genetics of asthma in latino americans gala study 20 the third sample consists of 1310 individuals from mexico city participating in a type two diabetes study that were genotyped with the affymetrix five point zero genechip the fourth sample contains three hundred and twelve subjects in the mexican genome diversity project mgdp recruited by the national institute of genomic medicine inmegen from throughout mexico including fortyeight subjects from guanajuato fifty subjects from guerrero fortyeight subjects from sonora seventeen subjects from tamaulipas fifty subjects from veracruz fortynine subjects from yucatan and fifty subjects from zacatecas 30 50 a map of the geographic distribution of mgdpinmegen samples is shown in figure s2 a description of all the validation samples is shown in table six point
 
we implemented a threepopulation model to estimate individual ancestry proportions from genomewide data using the program admixture 57 we filtered our genomewide markers to eliminate markers in linkage disequilibrium at r208 genotypes from ancestral populations described above defined the ancestral clusters relevant to latin americans we also estimated ancestry using the panel of aims identified with the protocol above the performance of the aims panel was established by calculating the correlation coefficient r2 and measures of discordance mean error mean absolute error and root mean squared error
 
using the validated aims panel we genotyped eighteen populations collected from bolivia colombia venezuela argentina and chile a description of the origin of the samples is provided in text s1 and in table seven and figure six point
 
labels in purple correspond to the native american ancestral populations labels in red to the validation samples and labels in black to the eighteen populations from throughout the americas mgdpinmegen samples were collected throughout mexico see figure s1 gala mexico samples were also collected in the san francisco bay area ca gala puerto rico samples were also collected in new york ny
 
subjects were genotyped on a sequenom platform with the four hundred most informative aims identified in phase i aims were included in the final analysis if they had a genotyping call rate greater than 95 and hardyweinberg equilibrium in each population individually we required that all samples had genotyping missing data rates of 10 sample population groups were excluded if they have average genotyping data rates of 10
 
file merging strand flipping allele frequency determination linkage disequilibrium calculations and identity by descent estimations were performed with the program plink 52 the algorithm to develop the panel of aims was implemented in python version two point six 58 individual ancestral estimates were performed with a threepopulation model using a modelbased likelihood estimation using the program admixture 57 statistical analyses were performed with r and python 58 59 estimation of time since admixture was performed using the program admixmap 60 61 62 assuming an average of twentynine years per generation 63

the seven studies included in this metaanalysis belonged to cogent and enrolled 16388 african american participants the supplementary text contains a detailed description of each participating cogent study cohort text s1 all participants selfreported their racial category additional clinical information was collected by selfreport and clinical examination all participants provided written informed consent as approved by local human subjects committees study participants who were pregnant or had a diagnosis of cancer or aids at the time of blood count were excluded we also excluded subjects who were outliers in the analysis of genetic ancestry as determined by cluster analysis performed using principal component analysis or multidimensional scaling or who had an overall snp missing rate 10
 
fasting blood samples for complete blood count cbc analysis were obtained by venipuncture and collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid platelet counts and mpv were performed at local laboratories using automated hematology cell counters and standardized quality assurance procedures methods used to measure the blood traits analyzed in this study have been described previously for aric cardia jhs health abc whi and genestar 5458 platelet count was reported as one hundred and nine cells per liter and was recorded in all 16388 study participants information on mpv was available in a subset of 4612 participants from five cogent study cohorts aric genestar health abc handls and jhs and was reported in femto liters 1015 l all the phenotypes were approximately normally distributed and we did not perform any data transformations
 
genotyping was performed within each cogent cohort using methods described in text s1 affymetrix chips were used in the aric cardia jhs and whi studies and illumina chips were used in genestar handls and health abc dna samples with a genomewide genotyping success rate 95 duplicate discordance or sex mismatch between genetic estimates of gender and selfreport snps with genotyping failure rate 10 monomorphic snps snps with minor allele frequency maf 1 and snps that mapped to several genomic locations were removed from the analyses because africanamerican populations are recently admixed we did not filter on hardyweinberg equilibrium pvalue instead significantly associated snps were later examined for strong deviations from hardyweinberg equilibrium andor raw genotype data was examined for abnormal clustering participants and snps passing basic quality control were imputed to 22 million snps based on hapmap ii haplotype data using a 11 mixture of europeans ceu and africans yri as the reference panel details of the genotype imputation procedure are described further under supplemental methods prior to metaanalyses snps were excluded if imputation quality metrics equivalent to the squared correlation between proximal imputed and genotyped snps were less than 050
 
differences in platelet count may affect platelet function and aggregation 59 in addition younger platelets have higher mpv than older platelets and are more reactive 60 we hypothesized that the genetic variants that determine platelet count and mpv may also affect platelet aggregation to examine this hypothesis we used agonistmediated platelet aggregation assays which can provide information about the different aspects of platelet aggregation for these assays platelet aggregation agonists such as collagen or adp are added to whole blood or plateletrich plasma and platelet aggregation is measured after a specified amount of time 300 seconds we performed platelet aggregation assays in the participants of the genestar cohort blood samples were obtained as described above and platelet aggregation in whole blood was measured as reported previously 57 briefly in vitro whole blood impedance in a chronolog dualchannel lumiaggregometer havertown pa was performed after samples were stimulated with arachidonic acid 05 mmoll intraassay cv  24 collagen 5 gml intraassay cv  9 or adp 10 moll intraassay cv  46 maximal aggregation within five minutes of agonist stimulation was recorded in ohms
 
for all cohorts genomewide association gwas analysis was performed using linear regression adjusted for covariates implemented in either plink v107 r v210 or mach2qtl v108 61 62 allelic dosage at each snp was used as the independent variable adjusted for primary covariates of age agesquared sex and clinic site if applicable the first ten principal components were also incorporated as covariates in the regression models to adjust for population stratification text s1 for genestar family structure was accounted for in the association tests using linear mixed effect lme models implemented in r 63 although the jhs has a small number of related individuals extensive analyses have shown that results were concordant using linear regression or lme after genomic control 19 therefore results are presented for jhs using linear regression for imputed genotypes we used dosage information ie a value between 0020 calculated using the probability of each of the three possible genotypes in the regression model implemented in plink or mach2qtl for cohorts with unrelated individuals or the maximum likelihood estimation mle routines for genestar
 
for both platelet phenotypes metaanalyses were conducted using inversevariance weighted fixedeffect models to combine beta coefficients and standard errors from study level regression results for each snp to derive a combined pvalue and effect estimate 64 study level results were corrected for genomic inflation factors gc by incorporating study specific gc estimates into the scaling of the standard errors se of the regression coefficients by multiplying the se by the squareroot of the genomic inflation factor the inflation factors for all completed analyses are presented in table s1 to maintain an overall type one error rate of 5 a threshold of   5108 was used to declare genomewide statistical significance betweenstudy heterogeneity of results was assessed by using cochranes q statistic and the i2 inconsistency metric metaanalyses were implemented in the software metal 64 and were performed independently by two analysts to confirm results to examine whether there were any differences between males and females sexspecific gwas were conducted in each cohort the results for each snp were pooled and heterogeneity of allelic effects between females and males was examined using the metaanalysis methods as implemented in gwama software 65
 
to assess whether the loci previously reported to be associated with the platelet phenotypes in europeans japanese and african americans were replicated in the cogent africanamericans we examined the metaanalysis results for each index snp in the regions previously reported including consistency of direction of effect if the reported index snp was not significant at p005 we examined adjacent snps and reported the closest snp with p005 along with its distance from the index snp
 
to examine the association of genotype on platelet aggregation in the genestar cohort linear mixed models were used with additive models adjusting for age and sex and taking into account familial correlation between the individuals

note that the following section only provides a brief summary of the methods applied to our study a much more detailed description can be found in text s1
 
for inclusion in pdgene a study has to meet three criteria 1 it must evaluate the association between a biallelic genetic polymorphism minor allele frequency 001 in the healthy control population of at least one study and parkinsons disease pd risk in datasets comprised of both affected defined as clinically andor neuropathologically diagnosed parkinsons disease and unaffected individuals 2 it must be published in a peerreviewed journal 3 it must be published in english for this manuscript we also included data on ten snps generated in the geopd consortium datasets 14 23 and obtained data for the newly identified snp rs7077361 in itga8 from the japanese gwas dataset 14
 
in brief genetic association data of the following studies were excluded from the metaanalyses see text s1 for details familybased studies without available subjectlevel data however unrelated casecontrol data enriched for familial cases were not excluded studies investigating only disease controls multiallelic polymorphisms and studies of polymorphisms in mitochondrial dna we also excluded genetic data of apparently poor quality if discrepancies could not be resolved after contacting the study authors eg inadequate genotypingsequencing protocols or discrepancies in terms of allele names or frequencies when compared with public databases more details can be found in text s1
 
our literature searches until march 31st 2011 yielded 27210 articles which were screened for eligibility using the title abstract or fullpapers as necessary additional screening of bibliographies in reviews published metaanalyses and original genetic association studies were also performed overall full text versions of 1534 articles were obtained following the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined above eight hundred and twentyeight articles were included in pdgene until march 31st two thousand and eleven also see figure 3
 
randomeffects allelic metaanalyses 31 were performed if a minimum of four independent datasets existed per polymorphism summary odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated irrespective of ethnic descent as well as for distinct ethnic groups ie caucasians and asians if sufficient data were available in addition we performed a number of sensitivity analyses excluding the initial studies and datasets in which hwe was violated in control individuals systematically assessed betweenstudy heterogeneity via i 2 and assessed the credibility of each at least nominally significant metaanalysis result by calculating bayes factors bf here expressed as log10bflogbf 25 and by determining a grading score developed by the human genome epidemiology network hugenet 26 27
 
this is of particular importance in metaanalyses of published association data and was carefully addressed here first we added publicly available gwas data 10 12 13 to the vast majority of snps since these data are typically unbiased this should decrease the potential for smallstudy biaspublication bias secondly for one hundred and fortyseven snps of the core pdgene metaanalyses that showed statistically suggestive results p01 we obtained additional data from all currently published but not publicly available gwas datasets further decreasing a potential impact of smallstudy biaspublication bias thirdly we directly assessed the evidence for small study bias by applying a recently proposed regression test 32 on all nominally significant p005 metaanalysis results the results of these analyses are fully displayed in table s1
 
we obtained individuallevel genotype data for all publicly available pd gwas datasets from ncbis dbgap database a total of three 10 12 13 at the time of the datafreeze march 31st 2011 genotype data were cleaned using standard procedures followed by imputation of untested genotypes using reference panels from hapmap and the one thousand genomes project and association analyses incorporating imputation uncertainty casecontrol datasets only age sex and population stratification overall this procedure led to a total of 7723931 unique snps 7123920 of which were present in at least two and 711271 in at least three datasets metaanalyses either combining teststatistics and standard errors using randomeffects models or by combining pvalues weighted by sample size see text s1 for more details were performed on the 7123920 snps present in at least two of the gwas datasets
 
after completion of all datamanagement and analysis steps all studyspecific variables genotype data except for gwas and metaanalysis plots are posted on a dedicated publicly available online adaptation of the pdgene database using the same software and code as our databases for alzheimers disease 33 and schizophrenia 34 the online database is hosted by the alzheimer research forum and can be accessed via its own designated url 
 
the database software can easily be ported to other genetically complex diseases and will be made available on a collaborative basis to interested researchers upon request

our main study population was the atherosclerosis risk in communities aric population the aric population consists of a large sample of unrelated individuals and some families across north america the population was recruited from four centers across the united states forsyth county north carolina jackson mississippi minneapolis minnesota and washington county maryland for this study we restricted our analysis to the europeanamerican group the population was recruited in one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven from the general population consisting of subjects aged fortyfive to sixtyfour years the aric population consisted of 8451 subjects
 
quality control and genotype calls for common snps were evaluated previously for aric using the affymetrix human snp array 60 we selected bilallelic autosomal markers based on the following criteria missingness 005 hardyweinberg equilibrium p106 and minor allele frequency 005 subjects with missingness 005 were removed this resulted in 436126 retained markers
 
quality control measurements from dbgap geneva aric project quality control report sept 22 2009 indicate significant population stratification between selfidentified white europeanancestory kind group and black populations when projected onto hapmap components furthermore principalcomponents analysis of the europeanancestory group by dbgap showed that no component explained more than 01 of the population variance for this study we only analyzed the europeanancestory group and treated it as a single population
 
aric phenotypes were adjusted for age sex and study center only single measurements from visit one were used for these subjects we only used subjects with negative diabetes status and with genotype and phenotype information for all traits this resulted in 8451 subjects we standardized all the traits we first logtransformed bmi glucose insulin triglycerides hdl and systolic blood pressure all laboratory measurements are under fasting conditions population trait statistics are in table s1
 
we estimated h2 and hg2 for height and bmi in the framingham heart study population fhs the fhs population is a large multigenerational dataset that started in one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight in framingham massachusetts in the united states it consists of a number of ethnicities predominantly from the united kingdom ireland italy and western europe 28 markers were screened similarly to aric and we also removed any snps that did not overlap with the aric set which results in 320118 snps we used principal components analysis of the linkage disequilibrium ld pruned genetic relationship matrix to identify components with variance 01 ld pruning was as in the aric two thousand and nine report this resulted in 73432 retained snps we found three significant components that were then used as covariates in the reml model for consistency with aric we restricted the age range at time of exam to fortyfive to sixtyfive years and randomly selected a single measurement in the case of multiple measurements phenotypes were adjusted for age sex and generation prior to the reml estimation and standardized we first logtransformed bmi population trait statistics are in table s2 our base fhs population consisted of 4240 subjects
 
we determined h2 using the linear mixedeffects model see derivation below and related individuals defined as genomic relatedness between zero point three five and 065 we assume that the common snps are in greater linkage disequilbrium among related individuals and as such can be used to estimate the total additivegenetic variance across the allele spectrum as suggested by visscher et al two thousand and six 9 we constrained the relationship matrix to have at least one related pair per subject this was done by pruning the entire population relationship matrix by randomly selecting a row and removing the row and its corresponding column if no genomic covariance in the row was between the cutoff values for all pairs including unrelated individuals we used their empirically defined relationship this resulted in five hundred and thirty individuals being selected for analysis in aric and 3663 individuals in fhs
 
h2 was estimated with h2  vargvargvare where varg and vare are the genetic and residual variance components estimated by the reml model using related individuals the error was estimated from the inverse fisher information see linear mixedeffects model below and propagated using a firstorder taylor expansion
 
we used the linear mixedeffects model and only unrelated individuals to estimate the additivegenetic variance attributable to the common snps hg2 unrelated individuals were defined as subjects with maximum genomic correlation of 0025 the genomic relationship matrix was then produced as above based on this cutoff the cutoff was taken from yang et al two thousand and ten 6 and is less than the expected coefficient of relatedness between 2nd cousins for these estimates we used the same group of 5647 unrelated individuals for all estimates in aric and 1489 individuals in fhs hg2 was estimated as hg2  vargvargvare where varg and vare are the genetic and residual variance components estimated by the reml model using unrelated individuals the standard error was estimated as above the height hg two versus snp number analyses were performed over allele frequency range of zero point zero five to zero point five in order of increasing and decreasing frequency
 
the genetic correlation rg is defined as  where vargti is the additive genetic variance of trait i and covariance covgtitj is the additive genetic covariance between the traits the variances and covariances are estimated directly in the multivariate linear mixedeffects model the error was computed from the estimated errors of the variances and covariance using a firstorder taylor expansion the residual and phenotypic correlations were analogously defined phenotype correlations and error were estimated by linear regression of the standardized phenotypes
 
the mean and errors for proportionality constants between the genetic and phenotypic correlations were determined by randomly sampling over the distributions of the parameter estimates ie monte carlo method assuming that the error around the mean parameter estimate was normally distributed and that the parameters were independent we then fit a linear function with the yintercept fixed at zero after first confirming that it was not significantly different from zero
 
we assessed significance for correlation coefficients r using the standardized fisher transformed estimate of r arctanrarctanser we estimated the twotailed pvalue from a normal distribution and significance was determined by p005 and bonferroni corrected for twentyone hypotheses
 
significance for regression coefficient  was estimated using the standardized coefficient  we estimated the twotailed pvalue from a tdistribution and twenty degrees of freedom and significance was determined by p005
 
preprocessing of snps and phenotypes was done using plink 29 v107 and matlab 2010b mathworks natick ma reml optimization was executed using software written in matlab
 
we considered the following multivariate linear mixedeffects model for m individuals n loci and t traits 68 17 18 30where y i is a m1 vector of trait i for m individuals x i is an ms fixed effects matrix for trait i v i is a s1 vector of fixed effects parameters for trait i z is an mn matrix of standardized genotypes u i is an n1 vector of random effects for trait i satisfying u in0g and e i is an m1 vector of residual effects satisfying e in0r with matrix blocks g ij  covgij i n and r ij  coveij i m and i l is the ll identity matrix this model can be used for single or multiple traits for two traits it is called a bivariate model the model is identical to that used by 6 7 17
 
we considered only biallelic snps in hardyweinberg equilibrium denote the minor allele by q and the major allele by q let the minor allele frequency at locus i have frequency p i we assign a value of two for genotype qq one for genotype qq and zero for genotype qq the hardyweinberg mean frequency for the genotype at locus i is 2p i and the variance is 2pi1pi the standardized genotype entries have values of 22p i2p i12p i12 for qq 12p i2p i12p i12 for qq and 2p i2p i12p i12 for the qq genotype
 
the log of the likelihood function is given bywhere the covariance matrix can be expressed as a tensor product with mm blocks v 1 ij and a is the genetic relationship matrix following yang et al 6 we used a modified covariance matrix for a  where the diagonals of a are computed using the formulawe use the restricted maximum likelihood reml approach 8 where the gradients of the log likelihood are given by where i ij is a tmtm dimensional matrix with zero entries except for a mm identity matrix at block location i j and  where 
 
we solved the reml equations using an em algorithm 8 which was given by for iteration k1 in terms of iteration k we iterated until the rate of change of the log likelihood function was less than about 104 we also checked that the rate of change of the square of the covariance predictions was less than 108 we checked our results against the software developed by yang et al gcta 31 for the univariate model
 
for the multivariate model we transformed to a coordinate system where the covariance matrices were diagonal 8 to speed up the computation let z j be the set of phenotypes for individual j we used the canonical transformation such that and  q can be computed from the formula where  s is the matrix of left eigenvectors of gr 1 the transformed genetic covariances are given by and the residual covariances are i t each step consisted of taking a single step with the univariate em algorithm for the transformed additive genetic and residual variance followed by a transformation back to the original coordinates we iterated until the maximum of the magnitudes of the components of the gradient of the log likelihood function was less than approximately 
 
in our computations we used both the direct em algorithm and the canonically transformed algorithm because even though the transformed algorithm was in principle faster it sometimes had poor convergence properties if the initial guess was not sufficiently close to the maximum likelihood value we ensured that both give the same results for computational efficiency the results shown are computed from the bivariate model for the different trait pairs we confirmed our results with a multivariate model that included all traits
 
our error estimates were given by the inverse of the fisher information matrix f which we computed by evaluating the hessian of the log likelihood at the maximum likelihood predictions f is a tt1tt1 dimensional matrix with rows corresponding to the genetic and residual variances and covariances where covij was set equal to covji and with block elements that are not all contiguous given byfor and

vat and sat were measured on ct following protocols established by each study as detailed in the studyspecific methods we created sexspecific residuals adjusting for age agesquared smoking and principal components derived from genotypes denoting population stratification the following traits were created in the overall sample and in women and men separately for each participating study vat sat vatadjustedforbmi and vatsat ratio vatadjustedforbmi provides insight into the relative amount of vat controlling for the degree of generalized adiposity whereas the vatsat ratio is a metric of the propensity to deposit fat viscerally as compared to subcutaneously the vatsat ratio has been previously shown to be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors 47 the correlation between vatadjustedforbmi and the vatsat ratio in the family heart study is zero point seven six p00001 n  2658
 
we created sexandcohort specific residuals which were then pooled and analyzed using variance components analysis solar 52
 
genotyping was conducted as specified in the table s1 and the study specific methods we applied qualitycontrol filters in order to exclude lowquality snps or samples based on ceu samples each study imputed 25 million phase two hapmap snps we used imputed allelic dosage in the analysis additional details can be found in table s1
 
the primary analysis was conducted in each cohort separately using regression analysis assuming additive genetic effects and accounting for dependence among family member when appropriate we accounted for principal components where necessary in order to prevent population stratification as well as the assumption of homogeneity within samples of european ancestry these results were gathered together and used to conduct a fixed effects weighted z metaanalysis to allow for differences in phenotype scaling across the participating studies using metal 53 we have previously shown that the association between singleslice vat and sat measurements at the l4l5 level is highly correlated with volumetric measurements r  095099 54 this approach weights the signed z statistics from each study by its sample size to obtain a weighted sum from which a p value is obtained we applied the genomic control correction to control type i error rates snps that reached a metaanalysis p value5108 were considered to be genomewide significant 55
 
stage two validation was conducted for our novel lead snp rs1659258 using data from studies not part of the present metaanalysis in the giant consortium data in sexspecific metaanalyses for bmi and waist circumference personal communication heid i et al pvalues for snps discovered in the present effort in association with adiposity phenotypes reported by the giant consortium were queried we concluded significant results when a directionconsistent pvalue was at least p005
 
for each validated snp we obtained sexspecific association results for lipid and glycemic phenotypes from the magic and glgc consortia
 
we performed formal tests of interaction of rs1659258 by sex women as compared to men and age stratified abovebelow age 60 briefly each study generated the interaction regression coefficient its standard error and its p value through regression for the sex interaction we included age agesquared smoking yesno sex and any principal components and study center that were used in the original discovery analysis we additionally added rs1659258 and the crossproduct rs1659258sex the age interaction analysis was performed in women only because the ages and health abc studies only included participants older than sixtyfive years they did not contribute to this analysis model covariates included age agesquared smoking yesno and any principal components and study center with the addition of rs1659258 and the crossproduct of rs1659258 and the dichotomized age term we metaanalyzed the interaction terms across all studies using the weighted zscore approach

our sample set consisted of one hundred and eleven individuals from four different species namely h melpomene h cydno h timareta and h heurippa table s1 in total fourteen races of h melpomene eight races of h cydno five races of h timareta and one of h heurippa were sampled covering most of the geographic distribution of each species from central to south america figure 1 h numata was included as outgroup dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy ninetysix blood  tissue kit one mitochondrial and eight nuclear fragments table s2 were amplified with qiagen taq dna polymerase purified using exosap and sequenced with abi big dye terminator two of the nuclear markers are unlinked to the hmb red locus whereas the remaining six are all located across the region table s2 from these colourlinked fragments optix and kinesin have previously been implicated in red wing pattern determination the remaining four were identified as regions under divergent selection with high levels of population differentiation associated with red colouration 31
 
sequences were aligned and cleaned using codon code aligner haplotype inference for heterozygous calls was conducted with the phase algorithm implemented in dnasp v51001 49 with five thousand iterations and allowing for recombination inferred haplotypes with a confidence higher than 95 were accepted in the case of the fragments hmb449k and hmb453k cloning was necessary due to the presence of considerable indel variation pcr products of these two markers were ligated into the pgemt easy vector and five to ten clones per individual were selected and sequenced sequences were deposited in genbank under accession numbers jx003980jx005837
 
for each fragment phased haplotypes were used to construct phylogenetic trees using the neighbourjoining method under the p model of uncorrected distance in paup 40b10 node support in the resulting trees was estimated by one thousand bootstrap replicates using a heuristic search to confirm the phylogenetic groupings obtained by neighbourjoining for hmb453k a maximum likelihood phylogeny was also constructed with phyml 50 using the gtrig substitution model selected by modeltest 51 and with branch support values obtained by one thousand bootstrap replicates the stability of the inferred phylogeny for hmb453k was examined using the shimodairahasegawa test sh test 35 in paup 40b10 for all phylogenetic inferences trees were rooted with h numata as outgroup
 
analysis of molecular variance amova with one thousand permutations implemented in arlequin v35 52 was used to assess population structure by species geography and phenotype for species four groups were set corresponding to h melpomene h cydno h timareta and h heurippa in the geography analysis haplotypes were grouped into six geographic regions i the guiana shield ii amazon iii pacific iv east andes foothills v cauca valley and vi magdalena valley these geographic clustering matches the biogeographic provinces i humid guyana ii napoimeri iii chocowester ecuadorarid ecuador iv north andean paramo v cauca and vi magdalena defined by morrone 53 when compared by phenotype haplotypes were grouped in three groups the redbanded type presence of red forewing band the rayed type presence of orange rays in the hind wing and the nonred type absence of any dorsal red element on the wings the outgroup h numata was excluded from these analyses
 
in order to estimate the role and direction of historical gene flow between h melpomene and h timareta h heurippa was included in h timareta for the purposes of this analysis we used the isolationmigration im bayesian model 36 im uses markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling to obtain maximumlikelihood estimates of six parameters current population sizes ancestral population size rates of migration between two populations m one and m 2 and the timing of divergence t im assumes both free recombination between loci and no recombination within them therefore the software sites 54 was used to select genetic blocks with no recombination within each locus to fulfill the assumption of free recombination between loci only the unlinked colour loci and one of the fragments linked to red colouration hmb453k were selected for this analysis we ran im on two modified datasets for each species pair i h melpomene rayed typeh timareta and ii h melpomene redbanded h heurippa and h timareta these groups constituted the maximal units in which we could get enough data without recombination with the rayed dataset being a block of three hundred and seventynine bp and the postman dataset one of three hundred and thirteen bp unfortunately pairwise comparisons involving all the species alleles were not possible nor were comparisons involving species in parapatry because such groupings contained small nonrecombining blocks that lacked enough informative sites however since our main interest was to determine the direction and magnitude of introgression m within phenotypes these datasets are sufficient for addressing this question for all datasets after searching for the parameter range using preliminary runs thirty million steps were sampled from the primary chain after a 300000 burnin period under the hky model with ten chains per set mixing properties of the mcmc were assessed by visual inspection of the parameter trend plots and by examining that the effective sample size ess was higher than 50 as recommended 36 37
 
to get biologically meaningful units of gene flow the maximum likelihood estimates and 90 highest posterior density hpd interval for the migration rates m were converted into the effective number of gene migrations received by a population per generation 2nm in table 2 for this conversion we used a generation time of thirtyfive days and a mutation rate per gene calculated with the calibration time proposed by wahlberg et al for nymphalidae 55 coupled with the divergence between the melpomenecydno clade per locus estimated with the software sites our estimates of mutation rate per locus per year were 62106 for coi 71108 for gapdh 12106 for hsp90 and 34105 for hmb453k
 
we finally compared the model including all six parameters to simpler demographic models in order to statistically test the hypothesis of zero or equal gene flow between populations m1  0 m2  0 m1  m2  0 m1  m20 these analyses were conducted using ima 36 by running the initial mmode output with identical settings in the lmode and sampling 5105 genealogies
 
we further tested the presence significance and direction of gene flow per locus between h melpomene and h timareta using a method based on linkage disequilibrium ld developed by machado et al in two thousand and two 38 in this test a positive difference between the ld among all pairs of shared polymorphisms dss and the ld among all pairs of sites for which one member is a shared polymorphism and the other is an exclusive polymorphism dsx is indicative of gene flow the magnitude of the difference directly measures the direction of the introgression with the species with the highest positive value being the recipient 38 the same phenotypic datasets used in the im analysis and also groups of species in complete sympatry were subjected to independent runs each of them with thirty thousand simulations the input files were prepared with the program sites 56 calculating d as a measure of linkage disequilibrium as suggested by machado et al 38 and analysing linkage disequilibrium among shared polymorphism between groups by choosing the s and p options in the ld string
 
linkage disequilibrium across the hmb region was calculated for all populations using the software midas 57 only considering sites with allele frequency higher than 5 and visualised with the r package ldheatmap 58

we obtained two cell types from coriell for this study skin fibroblast cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines lcls primary skin fibroblast cells from three human three chimpanzee and three macaque individuals lcls which are b cells immortalized with epsteinbarr virus were obtained from the same three human and three chimpanzee individuals that fibroblasts were isolated from table s1 ebv does not reliably transfect macaque lymphocyte cells so matched macaque lcls cells were not available for this study importantly other recent genomewide studies that used macaque lcls were of blymphocyte cells transformed with rhesus herpes papio virus a close relative of human ebv 57 cells from all species were grown in standard growth media fibroblast growth media consisted of gibcos mem 10370021 lglutamine 25030081 penstrep 15140122 and 10 fbs hyclone sh30070 lcls growth media consisted of gibcos rpmi 21870 media with lglutamine penstrep and 15 fbs we harvested fifty million cells for each individual biological replicate and allocated thirtyfive million cells for dnase assays dnaseseq and dnasechip ten million for genomic dna used as control for dnasechip array hybridization and five million for rna dgeseq expression analysis
 
dnaseseq libraries we generated as previously described 17 18 and sequenced via illuminas gaii sequencer dnasechip library preparations used for validation of our dnaseseq results were performed as previously described 24 25 and were hybridized to 1 encode nimblegen arrays 19 custom arrays were designed to cover the orthologous regions from chimpanzee and macaque dnasechip array intensities were compiled and significant dhs sites were called using chipotle 62 p0000001 peak cutoff
 
dnaseseq data generated from each species was aligned to the native genome human hg19 chimpanzee pantro2 and macaque rhemac2 using bwa 63 to directly compare three different primate species requires that they be aligned to a single reference sequence because both the chimpanzee pantro2 and macaque rhemac2 reference sequences were built from the existing human reference we converted all sequences to human coordinates to do this we converted each 20mer dnaseseq sequence from pantro2 or rhemac2 to hg19 with liftover 23 using a match setting of eighty percent after conversion to hg19 coordinates we used fseq 64 to identify dnasei hypersensitive dhs sites the fseq scores from the top 100000 peaks from each sample were used to determine how well chromatin openness correlates among all fifteen samples figure 1 this analysis uses a pairwise pearson correlation to compare the similarity among samples
 
we used the bioconductor edger package to define speciesspecific hypersensitive regions 26 edger is designed to detect differences in count data among groups of samples briefly it compares withingroup variances to betweengroup variances using a negative binomial model and selects entries with significant betweengroup differences it was designed for differential expression data such as dgeseq or rnaseq but it is similarly applicable to read counts generated by dnaseseq one key advantage of edger is a normalization procedure specifically designed for highthroughput sequencing studies 26
 
to locate significant differences in dnaseseq signal between species we first identified the union set of the top 100000 dhs sites as scored by fseq from all fifteen samples 9 fibroblasts and six lcls we used bxpython  to analyze the data we divided these regions into windows attempting to maximize the resolution of the windows while minimizing the number of windows required
 
we divided the union set into overlapping windows of three hundred bp dhs sites smaller than three hundred bp were expanded to three hundred bp regions larger than three hundred bp were tiled with overlapping windows the overlap varies depending on the size of the hypersensitive region to tile we start by finding the number of windows that would fit completely inside the defined hs site using the default overlap 100 bp if these windows discard fewer than 10 of the bases on each edge of the hs site we tile the site using these windows because the initial peak calls tend to run a bit wide if using the default overlap would cause us to lose more than this edge threshold 10 we add another window and adjust the overlap so the windows exactly cover the entire hs region these windows cover almost all of the hs bases in the original while minimizing the number of nonhs bases considered for the downstream analysis after defining the windows we liftover each window back to chimp and macaque and discard any windows that dont map we also eliminated any windows mapping to the y chromosome because we have female samples this resulted in 12 million windows across all dhs sites supplemental data file four in dataset s1
 
we next counted the number of reads dnase cuts that mapped within each window for each sample to be certain to compare only regions that are actually found in all three primates we omitted any windows that did not have at least one read count in at least one individual from each species we believe this is a reasonable filter since there is a basal level of dnase digestion throughout the genome and regions without any mapping reads in one species are likely caused by alignment ambiguities such reads are lost in the liftover process or reference problems
 
we then used edger to call windows with significantly different counts in each pairwise comparison at a false discovery rate of 1 this defined speciesspecific hs windows for example to define humanfibroblastspecific human dhs gain regions we selected any windows with significantly more counts in humans compared pairwise to both chimp and macaque fibroblasts we then merged any significant neighboring windows
 
to confirm that dnase sites detected in only a single species were not due to a liftover artifact or copynumber variation cnv we performed a reciprocal liftover reciprocal liftover discards regions that do not map 11 between species assemblies after defining a speciesspecific or common dhs sites common dhs described below in human coordinates we the lifted these windows back to pantro2 or rhemac2 we then compared number of reads from the original native genome alignment to the read count on the lifted hg19 reference we found that in general these scores correlate well however some windows differ in counts on each reference indicates liftover artifacts or cnvs windows with native counts exceeding the reference counts could result from counts from the native assembly being lifted to multiple places on hg19 likewise windows with more reads on hg19 than on the equivalent native assembly could be caused by several regions from the native genome lifting to a single location on hg19 since these may possibly artificially appear as chromatin gains or losses we filter out these scenarios by requiring that the number of reads on hg19 for chimpmacaque data be within 10 of the number of reads on the native assembly
 
some regions mapped to areas in the genome that are clear artifacts most likely cnvs these artifacts are expanses where one of the species has much higher levels of hypersensitivity than the others and are often located near centromeres or telomeres a dhs resulting from a massive expansion in one of our samples compared to reference genome appears as a large kb to mbscale dhs site encompassing the entire cnv andor dhs sites that cluster closely together we manually curated a list of such areas and filtered data mapping within these regions assembly filter we also eliminate abnormally sharp peaks which are likely caused by pcr artifacts reference assembly inaccuracies or small differences in copy number between our samples and the reference genomes if any thirty bp window within a region contains 75 or more of the reads in the entire region these regions are filtered out as sharp peaks ultimately we confirmed the regions by visually inspecting many using both the integrative genomics viewer igv 65 and the ucsc genome browser 23 these filters apply to dhs gains losses and common regions
 
chang et al 2002 showed that human skin and nonskin fibroblast samples collected from different locations along the body plane showed notable differences in transcriptional profiles 29 aware of this issue we made an effort to use fibroblast cultures made from only skin samples and from the same region of the upper arm all three replicates of macaque fibroblasts and one human fibroblast were confirmed from coriell to be from skin biopsies from the upper arm the other two locations were unknown since our analysis poses a strict requirement of dhs sites to be present in all three human individuals to be called a human dhs gain having at least one human sample with the biopsy site confirmed to be from the upper arm ensures that the human gains are not a result of human dhs gains being a result of for example all human fibroblasts isolated from lower leg likewise to be called a human chromatin loss dhs sites have to be absent in all three human samples but present in all chimp and macaque samples this biopsy location bias is again mitigated by at least one human sample being from the upper arm
 
the yerkes national primate center from where the chimpanzee skin fibroblasts were obtained from unfortunately do not document the exact location of biopsy while the standardized skin punch protocol calls for the location of the skin biopsies to be from the ear pinna personal communication with fawn connerstroud from yerkes we cannot be 100 sure that the samples were isolated from this location as described above human dhs losses are a result of signal being present in all three chimpanzee and macaque samples supporting that these regions are not due to chimp biopsy location we also want to reiterate that our skin fibroblast results are highly similar in lcl lines that are all uniformly derived from blood samples
 
we find that none of our chromatin gains and losses overlap the hox genes described in the chang et al two thousand and two paper 29 in addition a more recent analysis by rinn et al 30 using more comprehensive microarrays and more biopsy sites identified three hundred and thirtyseven expression array probes 299 unique genes that were shown to be highly associated with five different general biopsy site locations we have compared this list of genes to both speciesspecific chromatin gainslosses as well as speciesspecific gene expression and find 3 of the speciesspecific and common dhs overlap with the two hundred and ninetynine position specific genes similarly speciesspecific and commonly expressed genes also show 3 overlap table s12
 
in order ensure that our tests for selection were meaningful we wanted to compare chromatin gains and losses with a set of regions that were open in all species rather than simply choose dhs sites that have the highest scores we wanted to mirror the level of hypersensitivity to that of the speciesspecific regions this is important because speciesspecific dhs sites are not necessarily the strongest dhs sites we also wanted to select a set of regions similar in size to our sets of gains and losses to retain computational tractability
 
to select a set of matched common dhs sites we required that each window be similarly open in all nine samples from all three species to be considered similarly open in a given sample the number of counts must lie between the 20 and 80 quantiles for that sample in the corresponding speciesspecific regions for example we used the human dhs gains identified by edger to define the distribution for each of the three human samples and similarly for chimp and macaque as such our set of common regions is the set of all windows with dnase counts within this range for each of the nine samples figure 2d to reduce the number of common regions we found to the most representative set those that most closely match the average signal intensity of the differential dhs sites we narrowed the quantiles until we found a set of around one thousand common regions which we reasoned would be a sufficient number to examine summary statistics to ensure that our results are not biased for a specific set of common regions we repeated our experiments on a significantly larger set 11000 of common dhs sites using less stringent criteria 1090 quantile this larger set is even more enriched for promoter regions but does not change our conclusions data not shown
 
after identifying an initial set of potential common dhs sites we filtered out any that appeared to be appendages to other hypersensitive sites without this step many common dhs sites would map to the edge of a strong hypersensitive sites to ensure that a common dhs site is a standalone dhs site we examined the neighboring windows surrounding the initial set of common dhs sites if a common dhs site window contained fewer than 80 of the number of reads in the adjacent window on either side we filtered it out as most likely an appendage to a stronger dhs site this resulted in a final list of one thousand two hundred and fiftynine common dhs sites matched in intensity to the speciesspecific dhs sites we also ran this filter on dhs gains and losses and found that very few of the gains 35 and losses 38 get flagged as appendages of these many of them are flagged as a result of fdr threshold issues that simply didnt quite highlight a neighboring window and we would actually still consider this a legitimate gain region because gainloss appendages are relatively rare and are largely due to threshold issues we elected to retain them in our final list
 
in every comparison we reported more speciesspecific gains than losses the most important factor in determining the size of these lists is the level of significance we set by choosing a fdr to obtain lists that match in length we could simply adjust the fdr value for the lists to yield about the same number of regions instead we decided to keep the fdr constant and select varying numbers of dhs sites for each category
 
however it is still constructive to consider the disparity in other words at a constant fdr 1 why are there more speciesspecific increases than decreases this is possibly a result of purifying selection because dhs sites are regulatory and therefore tend to be conserved a loss of a dhs site probably confers a fitness disadvantage in this case we would expect to see more gains than losses
 
it is also possible that the prevalence of increases is simply a result of the way we constructed the significance test a dhs site is a sparse signal there are more closed regions than open regions combined this with the asymmetry of the evolutionary tree the chimp and human are more similar to each other than either is to the macaque a humanspecific increase requires both macaque and chimp to be closed the default while a humanspecific decrease requires both macaque and chimp to be open this latter scenario will happen less often because the relationship between chimp and human is closer than either to the macaque
 
in short the greater number of gains than losses in our analysis may reflect purifying selection on dhs sites however it may also simply be a result of the way we constructed the test particularly due to using an outgroup species to polarize the chromatin structure changes
 
we tested for evidence of positive selection using the dhs sites indicated as dhs gains losses and commons defined by edger and common analyses see above a branch model test 66 in hyphy 35 was used to assess evidence for positive selection on each the human and chimp branches hyphy uses a likelihood ratio test to compare two opposing models for the null hypothesis we specified a composite model that allowed for negative selection neutral evolution or relaxed constraint specifically on the branch of interest ie the human branch with negative or neutral evolution across the rest of the tree the alternative hypothesis modeled positive selection only on the branch of interest with negative or neutral evolution on the rest of the tree for each region hyphy performed a likelihood ratio test comparing these hypotheses and output a p value that can be interpreted as a level of evidence for positive selection in order to test the likelihood of either the null or alternative hypothesis we specify both the alignment of the region of interest as well as a background sequence alignment assumed to be evolving neutrally 67 for the alignment of the region of interest we used alignments of human chimp macaque and orangutan precomputed at ucsc for the background sequence we collected a separate set of local introns for each region to test following haygood et al 16 to define these background alignments we started with the ucsc knowngene definition of intron annotations and then filtered out all first introns splice junctions and hypersensitive sites in any of the fifteen samples in this study in this way we aimed to select sequences that are evolving neutrally after defining this set of neutral introns we used an expanding window centered on the region of interest to collect introns in a region up to one hundred kb surrounding the center we added introns to this collection sequentially as the window expanded until we reached an alignment of two thousand nucleotides if we were unable to find two kb of background introns within one hundred kb of sequence we discarded these regions this happens rarely introns are commonly assumed to be evolving neutrally 43 68 particularly when our filtering steps are taken into account however there are still likely to be regulatory sequences present in our background model either due to sequences containing dnasei hs sites in other cell types not tested or due to unannotated or misannotated transcripts in order to further correct for this possibility we performed each likelihoodratio test fifty times using fifty different bootstrapped versions of the background model we then averaged these p values to assign a final p value for each region this method has the effect of possibly discarding any elements under selection in some of the bootstrap replicates increasing our ability to detect positive selection even if we inadvertently chose some background regions under selection to test significance for a given set of regions eg human dhs gains we ordered the p values for selection on both hg19 and pantro2 then did a mannwhitney test to see if one branch has higher p values than the other table s10
 
the fibroblast dhs sites where we can polarize the differences using macaque all have significant differences in the direction we expect while the common regions do not have significant differences in the lcls where we are unable to polarize no macaque lcls were available we do not detect a significant difference this is likely due to a combination of two categories gains and losses that have competing selection ie lcl human dhs loss  human dhs losschimpanzee dhs gain
 
we calculated the observed fraction of overlaps between dhs sites and evolutionarily constrained regions using constrained regions defined by the genome evolutionary rate profiling gerp method 40 executed on enredo pecan ortheus epo 69 70 33way alignments epo alignments and gerp regions are available for download at the ensembl browser  we then constructed a null distribution of the fraction of expected overlaps by using the conservative genome structure correction gsc methodology described previously 19 41 42 we performed one thousand randomizations and calculated the mean and standard deviation from the null distribution to assess the statistical significance of the observed overlap figure 6d
 
we also used phastcons to explore degree of sequence conservation for each region we extracted the mean and max phastcons score from the primate phastcons table at ucsc we then compared the distribution of these scores across the regions to see how sequence conservation is related to hypersensitivity conservation figure s9
 
total rna purified from 510 million cells harvested from the same cell culture used for dnaseseq were also used to generate dgeseq expression libraries as previously described 12 71 polyadenylated rna is captured for enrichment of mrna and the oligo dt primer is used to make cdna briefly dgeseq is similar to serial analysis of gene expression sage where mrna abundance is assessed via counting short sequences of their cdna at specific restriction site locations these dgeseq libraries were sequenced using illuminas gaii sequencer and averaged ten million 20mer sequences for each sample which were then aligned to the samples native reference sequence using bwa we used edger to detect differences in tag counts across species by comparing intraspecies variances to interspecies variances using a negative binomial model and selects expressed genes with significant betweenspecies differences 26
 
unlike the analysis performed for comparing crossspecies dhs sites we did not liftover any nonhuman expression sequences to human instead we simply compared the dgeseq sequence counts that aligned to exonic regions within each species native sequence alignment supplemental data file five in dataset s1 because of the high level of homology of the exonic regions between the three primate species we directly compared tag count numbers between each of the orthologous genes for the genomewide expression correlation comparison figure 1 we normalized tag counts using edger to calculate the total library size for each sample and adjusting the tag counts accordingly so that relative differences between the depth of the sequencing reads did not influence the results next we filtered out genes that did not have at least ten combined tag counts between all of the samples to decrease the noise associated with genes that fall below the meaningful level as recommended for edger following these filters we compared the spearman correlation values between all of the samples and plotted the results as a heatmap with hierarchical clustering to show similarities within and between species and tissue types
 
using edger we identified genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the three primate species comparisons between species were performed on a pairwise manner comparing three individuals of one species against three individuals from a second species the same normalization method and filters used in the expression correlation analysis was also used prior to defining the differentially expressed genes differential gene expression was defined as genes having a p value cutoff of 005 using the macaque expression result as an outgroup we identified genes that displayed high or low expression specifically on the human and chimp branch for example genes we defined as highly expressed in human human upregulated genes are differentially expressed in both humanchimp and humanmacaque comparisons but not differentially expressed in the chimpmacaque comparison similar criteria were used to identify genes that display low expression in human compared to chimp and macaque human downregulated genes
 
to firmly establish the connection between differential chromatin and differential expression we tested for significance in overlap in both directions first we tested if differential dhs sites tend to be located near differentially expressed genes and second we tested if differentially expressed genes tend to have differential dhs sites nearby
 
we compared human dhs gain human dhs loss chimpanzee dhs gain and chimpanzee dhs loss regions to speciesspecific genes eg human upregulateddownregulated genes etc we first assigned each dhs site its nearest gene then intersected these with each differential expression set the number of overlaps for every pairwise combination of dhs sites vs differentially expressed genes are shown in table s5a we calculated p values by permuting 100000 times the set of all expressed fibroblast genes randomly selecting the number of genes for each comparison and intersecting those random sets with the genes nearest speciesspecific dhs sites table s7bs7c this established a null distribution of overlaps in random intersects
 
to establish the connection in the opposite direction we did a similar analysis in the reverse direction using the ucsc knowngene table we merged all isoform coordinates for each gene and found all dhs sites within a surrounding twenty kb window we calculated pairwise overlaps of dhs sites between each differential dhs site list and these lists of all nearby dhs sites if a gene contained a differential dhs site within twenty kb it was counted as a match the number of overlaps for every pairwise combination of sites near differentially expressed genes vs differential dhs sites are shown in table s6a we then permuted genes similar to above 1000 times located all nearby dhs sites and tested for overlap to create a null distribution of overlap count table s8bs8c
 
to connect sequence changes to speciesspecific dhs sites we compared jaspar motif scores across species we first extracted the orthologous dna sequences for human chimpanzee and macaque for each of our dhs gain loss and common sites we scanned and scored each of these sequences for all the position weight matrices pwms in the jaspar database we scored a sequence for a given pwm as the highest motif score anywhere in that sequence this resulted in a regionbymotif matrix of scores each score is the highest score for each motifsequence combination to compare species we took the log ratio of scores humanchimp humanmacaque and chimpmacaque where this score is 0 the highest score does not differ between species deviations from zero indicate the direction of improvement in motif match in a humanchimp comparison a positive number means the best match in the human sequence scored higher than the best match in the chimp sequence after calculating these scores and each pairwise logratio we plotted the logratios supplemental data files 23 in dataset s1 and figure 7 to examine trends we calculated the pairwise logratios for multiple species comparisons and plotted these on different axis to check whether increases over one species correlate with increases over the other in these twodimensional plots each axis quantifies a different pairwise species relationship points that cluster in the upperright quadrant have higher scores than either of the other species points that cluster in the lowerleft have lower scores the most interesting variation in these plots is whether the points congregate in the upperright or lower left to assess significance we project each data point onto the y  x line to reduce the dimensionality to one point we then used the wilcoxson ranksum test to compare each distribution to the distribution of the common regions figure 7g and supplemental data file three in dataset s1

we performed a genome wide association study gwas metaanalysis of 21791 individuals table s1 9390 women 12401 men from ten observational studies data from an additional six studies totaling 7046 individuals table s2 4509 women 2537 men were used for validation the proportion of variance explained was estimated in an independent study inchianti n  1129 the individual study protocols were approved by their respective institutions ethics committeeinstitutional review board and all participants provided informed consent prior to participation individuals known to be taking hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy at time of shbg measurement were excluded from analysis age sex and body mass index bmi were included as covariates after applying standard quality control measures imputed genotypes were available for approximately two point five m snps see figure two for an overview of the analytic plan and the text s1 for further information for individual studies included in this metaanalysis
 
the initial starting point for the conditional analysis was the four shbg locus snps that all showed low hapmap ld r2005 with each other rs12150660 lead snp table 1 rs6258 p  271046 rs1625895 p  121014 and rs3853894 p  251011 each cohort fitted a single regression model fitting shbg concentrations against these four genomewide significant shbg locus snps rs12150660 rs6258 rs1625895 and rs3853894 in addition to age sex and bmi after metaanalyzing the results from all cohorts three of the snps retained genome wide significance when regressed against each other with the fourth snp narrowly missing that threshold rs3853894 p  41106
 
we next performed a conditional gwas metaanalysis where each study included as additional covariates to the original analysis plan the ten genomewide significant autosomal snps the eight main signals from table one and the two unique shbg locus signals described above in addition to the lead snp rs12150660 rs6258 and rs1625895 three additional signals independence based on hapmap r2005 at the shbg locus reached genomewide significance rs1641537 p  781032 rs6259 p  151012 and rs10432029 p  3108 giving a total of six independent signals in this gene region in addition two novel signals reached genomewide significance in the conditional analysis at 7q213 rs3779195 p  1108 and 2p163 rs10454142 p  3108 after replication only rs3779195 at the baiap2l1 locus retained genomewide significance
 
given the six signals observed at the shbg locus three through conditional analysis 1 rs12150660 rs6258 rs1625895 three through ld estimates from conditional gwas 1 rs1641537 rs6259 rs10432029 we sought to confirm which of these six were truly independent by a second round of conditional analysis all discovery and replication cohorts fitted a single regression model of the six snps snps  16 table 2 against shbg concentrations using the same parameters and covariates as conditional analysis 1 four of the six snps 14 rs12150660 rs6258 rs1641537 and rs1625895 retained genomewide significance when conditioned against each other with two showing nominal evidence of association snp 5 rs6259 p  00001 snp 6 rs10432029 p  001
 
finally we performed a second conditional gwas analysis adjusting for the six shbg locus snps which had evidence of association from conditional analysis 2 all the discovery cohorts were used in this analysis in addition to three replication cohorts total sample size 24354 this analysis revealed evidence for a further three independent signals at the shbg locus based on hapmap r2001 snp 7 rs9901675 p  15107 snp 8 rs8077824 p  46105 and snp 9 rs9393218 p  99106
 
we performed a sensitivity analysis using samples from the one thousand nine hundred and sixtysix northern finland birth cohort nfbc1966 study to further investigate allelic heterogeneity at the shbg locus text s1 the conditional metaanalysis showed evidence for up to nine signals at the shbg locus but it is possible that these signals could be explaining a much smaller number of causal variants in the region since one thousand genomes imputation allows us to assess the genetic variation associated with a phenotype across a much denser set of markers it increases our power to detect allelic heterogeneity within a region therefore one thousand genomes imputation was carried out on all the samples in the nfbc1966 study and forward selection was used to identify the set of snps that best explain the variation in the shbg phenotype one thousand genomes imputation was carried out using impute2 the mean genotype probabilities for each snp were calculated and used in the model selection step only snps two hundred and fifty kb upstream and two hundred and fifty kb downstream from the shbg locus 72834537786700 bp were used in the analysis all snps with maf 01 or an imputation quality score less than zero point four were excluded from the analysis in total one thousand nine hundred and seventyeight shbg region snps measured or imputed in four thousand four hundred and sixtyseven samples from the nfbc1966 study were used in the sensitivity analysis forward selection was implemented in r version 2130 using the stepaic package to estimate the akaikie information criterion aic an inclusion parameter given the high degree of correlation between the snps in this region we increased the penalty k on the number of terms included in the model to twelve where it is usually two to minimize possible over fitting the final model included seven snps adjusted for sex and bmi
 
we examined potential interactions among the proteins encoded by the shbg locus and the proteins encoded by the eleven genes zbt10 tdgf1 znf652 prmt6 jmjd1c gckr baiap2l1 lhcgr slco1b1 ugt2b15 nr2f2 closest to the eleven identified snps using pathway analysis with search tool for the retrieval of interacting genesproteins string pathways analysis wwwstringdborg the interactions explored by string include direct physical and indirect functional associations we then expanded the analysis to examine protein interactions among the shbg gene and the proteins encoded by sixtyseven genes within five hundred kb of the eleven identified snps
 
we conducted targeted analysis of two strong candidate genes hepatocyte nuclear factor4 hnf4 and peroxisomeproliferating receptor  ppar statistical significance thresholds were set correcting for the number of snps tested in each gene region 100 kb

plasmids and bacterial strains are listed in table one point all three pq plasmids express the indicated q components constitutively and have been described 35 36 61 the rtin mutant carries a tandem duplication of 2158uuaa2161 that corresponds to 416419 in the target sequence cell transformations with the plasmids were performed using cacl2 62 unless otherwise indicated rth cells were grown in luriabertani medium lb supplemented with two mm cacl2 and one hundred gml trimethoprim tmp while nr16205 cells were grown in lb containing fifteen gml tetracycline cells and phages were plated using lb bottom agar with 20 bacto agar the top agar was always made up in distilled water for counting plaques or scoring mutants the top agar contained 04 sigmaaldrich noble agar for other uses it contained 08 bacto agar all growth was at 37c
 
nr16205 cells were transformed with pqm100 which expresses wt q and plated on nr16205 lawns to yield wt q plaques which were independently harvested into tubes containing one ml d broth 02 bacto tryptone 05 nacl and twentyfive l of chloroform for onestep growth curves in rth cells ten l of phage suspension from a wt q isolate was mixed with one ml of cells at od60005 108 cellsml at a multiplicity of infection moi001 for twenty min at room temperature centrifuged to remove nonadsorbed phages resuspended and serially diluted in lbtmp samples diluted 103 and 105fold were held for three h at 37c with gentle shaking and 100l aliquots were removed from each dilution every ten min and plated with rth cells plates were incubated overnight and the followon titers were used to estimate q densities over time three onestep growth experiments were conducted in parallel for each wt q isolate used to generate onestep lysates visual inspection of the resulting curves sufficed to determine the time 75 min for q to complete one infection cycle in rth cells these onestep curves were also used to estimate the burst size of wt q in rth cells according to the protocol detailed for rtin and rtsub see table s1
 
the distribution of rt  revertants among rt  bursts was monitored as in a previous study 8 using two different rt  mutants rtin and rtsub as described in table 1 preliminary measurements provided their burst sizes figure s2 table s1 and revertant frequencies which are needed to conduct the burst experiments ten and five independent experiments were carried out with rtsub and rtin respectively and 500 rt  revertants were scored per mutant in each experiment 106 phages were added to one ml of rth cells at od60005 after twenty min of adsorption at room temperature the mixture was centrifuged for one min at 8000 g and the pellet was resuspended in one ml lb broth from the supernatant one hundred l were collected to estimate the amount of nonadsorbed phages the resuspended pellet was further diluted and fifty aliquots of one hundred l each were distributed into individual tubes where infection was allowed to continue for 75 min at 37c and then stopped with fifteen l of dichloromethane lysates were aerated for thirty min at 37c to allow the dichloromethane to evaporate and their entire volumes were then independently plated on nr16205 lawns the observed distributions of rt  revertants were compared to the expected poisson distributions using gtests for goodnessoffit
 
to limit the number of infection cycles to one before seeking spontaneous mutants rt mutants were scored among the progeny of onestep growth of wt q in rth cells rth cells were infected with wt q moi001 as above and onestep lysates were recovered by adding chloroform after seventyfive min of growth samples from the lysates were plated on rth lawns at 70 plaques per plate and wellisolated plaques were independently sampled into 96well plates containing zero point six ml dbroth per well reserving six uninoculated wells as crosscontamination controls for each of four independent lysates three different rounds of six hundred and thirty isolations each were performed in each round a control plate containing eight wt and eightytwo rtin isolates was also established to confirm the ability of rth cells to complement rt mutants and the inability of any rth cells remaining in the isolates to grow in lb supplemented with tetracycline isolates were spotted in parallel on lawns of nr16205 and rth cells using a 68array replica plater after a few losses a total of seven thousand five hundred and seventeen plaques were tested isolates that grew poorly in nr16205 cells were retested in both bacterial strains and the rtcoding genes of two independent subisolates per putative rt mutant were sequenced after this first round of sequencing two additional subisolates as well as the original isolate were sequenced for each verified rt mutant the original wt q isolate used to develop each lysate and two subisolates of it were also sequenced
 
plate lysates were prepared from rth cells 025 ml at od60005 mixed with phages at moi01 in noble top agar after overnight incubation the plates were covered with seven ml of sm buffer with gelatin 62 and were gently rocked for thirty min the sm buffer was recovered and one hundred l of chloroform were added to each sample cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000 g for ten min the supernatant was supplemented with polyethylene glycol peg 8000 to 10 wv and nacl to one m incubated for one h on ice and centrifuged at 3000 g for fifteen min at 4c 63 the pellets were resuspended in two ml of ten mm mgso4 ten mm trishcl ph 8 and the resulting concentrated phages were used as sources for rna purification phage rna was isolated using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit from the extracted rnas ten g were then treated with dnase i new england biolabs to degrade residual host dna the dnasetreated product was purified using the rnaeasy mini kit from the purified rna one g was subjected to reverse transcription with the omniscript rt kit and about twentyfive ng of the rt product was amplified with pfuturbo dna polymerase stratagene pcr products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis purified with the qiaquick pcr purification kit and sequenced using bigdye terminator v31 applied biosystems all kits were purchased from qiagen and were used according to the manufacturers recommendations subisolates showing secondary mutations were subjected to a second round of rt amplification and sequencing the primers utilized in the rt pcr and sequencing reactions and the pcr cycling parameters are listed in table s2
 
the rt and genome base compositions were compared using the gtest of independence this test was also applied to compare the observed distributions of rt  revertants among the singleburst reversion tests conducted with each of two different rt  mutants rtsub and rtin the gtest for goodness of fit was used to compare the observed and expected poisson distributions of rt  revertants among rt  singlebursts and the replicated gtest for goodness of fit was applied to compare the gc content of the local sequence environment six to seven bases upstream of the base substitutions observed in rt with the expected content according to the base composition of the whole gene when applying this last test each upstream position from 1 to 6 or 7 was considered as an independent replicate all tests were performed as per sokal and rohlf 64

the population architecture using genomics and epidemiology page study is a national human genome research institute funded effort examining the epidemiologic architecture of common genetic variants that have been reproducibly associated with human diseases and traits 35 the page study consists of a coordinating center and four consortia with access to large diverse populationbased studies including three national health and nutrition examination surveys the multiethnic cohort the whi the aric study the coronary artery risk disease in young adults study the cardiovascular health study the hispanic community health studystudy of latinos the strong heart study and the strong heart family study
 
this page metabochip study included african american participants from the aric and whi ct studies participants from the other page studies were excluded from this effort due to the unavailability of ecg measures andor genotype data genotypes of whi ct participants were obtained in three phases two sets of women were directly genotyped on the metabochip platform by page investigators during wave one n  797 and wave two n  1128 and women n  3531 with metabochip variants imputed from previous genomewide snp data provided by the whi share 36 participants meeting the following criteria were excluded from the study qt unavailable atrial fibrillationatrial flutter on ecg left or right bundle branch block on ecg qrs duration 120 milliseconds intraventricular conduction delay on ecg pacemaker implant antedating ecg ancestry outlier excessive heterozygosity low call rate or second member of first degree relative pair further details on the aric and whi ct studies are provided in text s1 participating studies
 
for each study certified technicians digitally recorded resting supine or semirecumbent standard 12lead ecgs at study baseline for each participant using marquette mac pc machines ge healthcare milwaukee wi usa the aric and whi ct studies used comparable procedures for preparing participants placing electrodes recording transmitting processing and controlling quality of the ecgs qt was measured electronically using the marquette 12sl algorithm
 
the metabochip was a custom illumina iselect array that contained approximately 195000 snps and was designed to support large scale follow up of putative associations for cardiovascular and metabolic traits including qt blood pressure cholesterol type two diabetes and anthropometrics approximately 33 of the metabochip snps were included as replication targets and 62 for finemapping in total two hundred and fiftyseven loci were selected for finemapping with the surrounding regions totaling fortyfive point five mb accounting for overlaps 142 mb for the densest finemapping regions eleven qt loci identified in previous gwa studies in populations of european and asian ancestry were represented on the metabochip table 1 the only published qt locus that is not represented on the metabochip is an intergenic region on 13q14 reported by marroni et al 19 but not replicated by other published gwa studies of populations with similar ancestral backgrounds snps reported in the literature but not genotyped on the metabochip nos1ap rs10494366 ndrg4 rs7188697 rs37062 were represented by proxies defined as snps in high ld r2090 with the index snp using hapmap yri data
 
samples were genotyped at the human genetics center of the university of texashouston and the translational genomics research institute for aric and whi respectively following each genotyping centers standard procedures hapmap yri yoruba in ibadan nigeria samples were also genotyped independently by each study to facilitate crossstudy quality control genotypes were called separately for each study albeit with a common protocol and common personnel with genomestudio using the gencall two point zero algorithm because the metabochip includes snps with much lower mafs than are usually called with gencall snps were recalled using the genosnp genotypecalling algorithm 37 snps with call rates 95 hardyweinberg equilibrium p106 1 mendelian error in thirty yri trios 2 replication errors or 33 discordant calls in yri across genotyping centers or against the hapmap database were considered quality control failures samples with call rates 095 or an inbreeding coefficient f015 were excluded from further analysis 38
 
prior to analyses related participants were identified using plink 39 by estimating identicalbydescent statistics for all pairs when apparent firstdegree relative pairs were identified the member from each pair with the lower call rate was excluded from further analysis principal components of ancestry were determined using the eigensoft software 40 41 and apparent ancestral outliers were excluded from further analysis
 
briefly n  1962 whi participants who were genotyped on both the affymetrix six point zero and metabochip genotyping platforms were used to infer metabochip genotypes to the n  8421 population of whi participants genotyped on the affymetrix six point zero array 36 before phasing and imputation affymetrix six point zero snps with genotype call rates 90 hardyweinberg pvalues106 or maf001 were removed participants with call rates 95 those who demonstrated excess heterozygosity were part of a firstdegree relative pair or who were identified as an ancestry outlier were excluded this yielded a set of 987749 snps for the 1962 reference participants mean concordance rates for the 23703 snps in common was 997 haplotypes were reconstructed using mach and were used as a reference to impute metabochip data into the 6459 whi participants with only affymetrix six point zero data liu et al 2012 demonstrated the ability to impute 999 975 836 520 205 of snps with maf005 003005 001003 0005001 and 00010005 with average dosage r2  947 921 890 831 and 797 respectively for this analysis all imputed snps with r2095 were excluded
 
to interpret finemapping results ld in our african american page metabochip sample was calculated in five hundred kb sliding windows using plink in addition metabochip ld and frequency information but not individuallevel information was provided by the malmo diet and cancer study on 2143 control participants from a swedish population 42 to facilitate ld and maf comparisons to populations of european ancestry hapmap ceu ld data were used for previously published gwa studies in european populations as not all european index variants were represented on the metabochip regional association plots use positions from ncbi build thirtysix point recombination rates were estimated from hapmap phase ii data
 
linear regression models were used to study the association between qt and 6670 snps from eleven regions finemapped for qt assuming an additive genetic model and including age sex study center ancestry principal components and heart rate as covariates studyspecific association results were combined using an inverse variance metaanalysis approach as implemented in metal 43
 
for each qt locus it is expected that snps associated with qt in african americans will be correlated with the index snp reported in europeans therefore we first identified and tested snps that are correlated r2020 with the index signals in europeans using ld statistics estimated in the malmo diet and cancer study in order to determine the appropriate multiple testing threshold for declaration of whether the previously identified signals were significantly associated with qt in african americans ie generalizability we then estimated the number of tag snps needed to capture all common alleles r2080 using african american ld patterns the multiple testing threshold for declaring generalization was a  005415 where four hundred and fifteen  the total number of tags identified using african american ld patterns
 
to identify significant populationspecific snps influencing qt that were not correlated with the index signal in europeans ie r2020 which was estimated in the malmo diet and cancer study we used an efficient monte carlo approach that accounts for ld between snps at the previously identified qt loci b  137105 44 conditional analyses were then performed to determine the number of independent signals the populationspecific snps represent specifically analyses were repeated for each locus including the snp with the smallest p  value as a covariate this approach was performed adjusting for successively less significant snps until no snps with p values lower than b  137105 were identified to facilitate comparability with previous reports examining the proportion of variance in qt explained by common snps heart ratecorrected qt 45 was regressed on the six best markers in african americans and the three populationspecific variants assuming an additive genetic model and including age sex study center ancestry principal components as covariates
 
for each of the nine qt snps ie the six best markers in african americans and the three novel snps we identified all snps in ld r205 using the genotypes from the african american population described in this study we refer to these snp sets as trait associated snp tas blocks we assigned each tas to one or more of the functional annotation datasets listed in table s5 these datasets are not mutually exclusive for example a tas can reside in both a candidate regulatory element dataset 7 and a ctcf binding site dataset 10 for tass that occur within predicted transcription factor binding sites datasets 3 and 8 we calculated transcription factor binding affinity for each tas allele using pwmscan 46 as described previously 47 for tass that occur within 3 untranslated regions we used the targetscans algorithm to determine whether they disrupt likely microrna target sites dataset 5 to define candidate nonpromoter regulatory elements of greatest relevance to qt dataset 7 we restricted the analysis of dnase i hypersensitive sites open chromatin loci to only those present in human cardiomyocytes

in order to keep our problem simple we condition on two important parameters we assume that the exact site under selection is known from extraneous information and we furthermore assume that the allele frequency f cur of that site at the time of sampling t cur  zero is known the interpretation of the parameters is depicted graphically in figure 1a
 
unless noted otherwise we assume a panmictic diploid population of size n with an additive selection model where the ancestral homozygous heterozygous and derived homozygous genotypes have fitness 1 1 s2 and one  s respectively however the methodology applied here can easily be adapted to more complex scenarios eg models involving multiple populations more sophisticated demographic models and other models of selection for most simulated data sets we will report the population scaled mutation rate   4ns as the shape of the allele frequency trajectory depends only on that compound parameter 25 however for most of the genes we analyze previous estimates were made directly on s rather than the compound parameter to facilitate comparisons we report s for the genes we analyzed
 
the sweep from a de novo mutation sdn models a single selective sweep and has two parameters the mutation rate  and the selection coefficient s for all simulations we follow 80 and record the time t zero when the mutation arose as t zero depends stochastically on s the prior distributions we use for this model were   u05e86e8 and log10s  u305 where u is a uniform distribution
 
the sweep from standing variation ssv model is identical to the de novo mutation model with the exception that we define a frequency f one at which the mutation becomes selected unless noted otherwise the priors for  and s are the same as in the sdn model and the prior for f one is f one  u002 in addition to t 0 which is defined analogous to the sdn model we are also interested in t 1 the time when the mutation becomes selectively advantageous ie the time when the mutation reaches frequency f 1
 
we also consider a neutral model nt without any selection the only free parameter in this model is the mutation rate  with the same prior distribution as described under sdn model as under the selection model however we still condition on one site having reached a final allele frequency of f cur so this model does not correspond to the classical neutral coalescent
 
we use a standard abc approach 31 32 using a postsampling adjustment in the form of a glm 96 we used the abctoolbox package 40 for specifying priors rejection sampling and postsampling adjustment unless specified otherwise we perform one hundred and five simulations per model and retained the one hundred 01 simulations with associated euclidean distance between observed and simulated summary statistics closest to zero to assess how the number of simulations and acceptance rates influence our results we analyze 10000 random data sets with up to one hundred and seven simulations and varying acceptance rates we show that these parameters have very little impact on the relative error for both the model choice and parameter estimates in table s1
 
we use a diverse array of summary statistics with the goal of maximizing the information captured while not incluing any statistics that just add noise the statistics we used may be broadly classified into statistics based on haplotype patterns and statistics based on the site frequency spectrum the haplotype based statistics we used were ihs 19 and ehh 9 we recorded ehh in a ten kb twenty kb and fifty kb window centered on the selected site for the sfs based statistics we used tajimas d 20 fay  wus h 23 the average number of pairwise differences  and the number of segregating sites s as statistics all these statistics are calculated for three regions a central region of twenty kb around the selected site an intermediate region consisting of all sites 2050 kb away from the selected site and a faraway region consisting of all sites further than fifty kb away from the selected site following 97 we linearize all statistics using a boxcoxtransformation 98 to choose a set of informative summary statistics we used a partial least squares discriminant analysis plsda 99 100 plsda is a variant of partial least squares regression that similarly to principal component analysis extracts orthogonal components from a highdimensional data set in this case the summary statistics in contrast to pca in plsda these components are chosen such that the covariance between summary statistics and models is maximized see eg 101 we did our computations using the plsda function of the mixomics package for r and kept the five first plsda axes 100
 
abc has two crucial parameters independent of the model it is applied to the number of simulations n s and the acceptance rate  to assess the effect of these parameters on inference we calculate the accuracy of our model choice estimates for various values of n s and  table s1
 
all our data sets used for both the abc inference and the assessment of our procedure are simulated using a modified version of the coalescent simulator mbs 102 mbs allows simulation of genetic data sets with a single selected site using the structured coalescent 26 mbs first simulates the allele frequency trajectory of the site under selection and then generates a data set conditional on that trajectory we simulate allele frequency trajectories using eulers method on the unscaled backwards diffusion equation with selection eq seven point one in 103 this equation makes it very easy to incorporate population size changes by just changing the variance term to simulate sweeps from standing variation we set the selection coefficient s to zero the first time the trajectory reaches f one point to analyze simulated data sets we generally simulate a one hundred kb region with a recombination rate of one point five cmmb for the human genes we simulate the gene and a fifty kb flanking region on both sides resulting in regions that are usually between one hundred kb and one hundred and fifty kb wide recombination rates and hotspots are modeled by using the hapmap recombination map 104 in the application to selected genes for all simulated data sets we assume a constantsized population for the analysis of human genes we use the population history estimated by 105 specific regions and details of the used regions are given in table s2 to ensure that our method does not suffer from a high false positive rate we also analyze regions five mb downstream from the candidate genes as they are presumably neutral for three of genes aspm g6pd and psca no data was available for these downstream regions so we analyzed the remaining loci candidate loci for selection were chosen using the following criteria i they were required to have a derived allele frequency between zero point seven and zero point nine and ii to be as closely to five mb away from the actual candidate locus in the upstream gene as possible
 
we estimate parameters from our models using the standard abc procedure described above the parameters we estimate are the mutation rate  the age of the sweep t one the selection coefficient s and only under the ssv model the initial frequency f one for the ssv model in particular we want to determine if our posteriors are unbiased and if we were able to get reasonable confidence in our estimates to do this we simulate data sets with fixed parameters and plotted the average posterior distribution for all parameters in figure two point
 
for model choice our main goal is to calculate the relative probabilities of the models given the data ie prssv  data prsdn  data and prnt  data which we calculate using the marginal densities as proposed by 96 to identify parameter regions where there is power to distinguish between the models we simulate 1000 data sets each under thirty different scenarios in three series corresponding to three parameters of interest the strength of selection  the frequency when the mutation became selective advantageous f1 and f cur the frequency at which the mutation is observed
 
to test the algorithm for approximating bayes factors we also use a simulation approach the estimator of the posterior probability from k simulations  should have the property where m is a model indicator functions for a specific model also for a particular draw from the posterior m 0 we expect  if the simulation algorithm works properly in other words  should asymptotically equal  ie if  c we expect a proportion c of simulations to have been obtained from model m equivalently for an estimated log bayes factor log10  c we expect a proportion 10c110c of draws to be from model m this prediction is tested in figure s8 based on 10000 random data sets from both the sdn and ssv model

cells transformed with the vector plasmid pgb2 or one of the lowcopy number plasmids expressing wildtype pol v or umuc variants were grown overnight at 37c in lb media plus spectinomycin the next day cultures were diluted 100fold into ten ml fresh media and grown at 37c until they reach an od600 of zero point one roughly three hrs cells were centrifuged and resuspended in an equal volume of sm buffer 58 and transferred to a petri dish aliquots were removed and saved as the unirradiated control for the experiments the culture was irradiated at a uv fluence of 2 jm2 per second and aliquots removed at twenty jm2 increments at least three independent cultures were assayed for each strain and all experiments were performed under yellow light to avoid unwanted photoreactivation
 
for uv survival assays appropriate serial dilutions based upon trial assays were plated on lb agar plates containing spectinomycin and incubated overnight at 37c the surviving fraction was determined by dividing the number of viable cells exposed to uv by the number of viable cells in the unirradiated culture error bars represent the standard error of the mean sem
 
to determine the number of spontaneously arising histidine mutants on the plate as well as uvinduced mutants the unirradiated cell culture was seeded on the davis and mingioli minimal agar plates 59 plus glucose 04 wtvol agar 10 wtvol proline threonine valine leucine and isoleucine all at one hundred gml thiamine 025 gml and either no histidine or histidine 1 gml on the plates containing no histidine only preexisting his mutants grew to form colonies however on the plates containing one gml histidine 100200 his cells are able to grow on the limiting amount of histidine so that a viable cell count can be obtained under the exact same conditions where his mutant arise when 4107 bacteria were seeded they grew to form a lawn concomitantly exhausting the low level of histidine spontaneously arising his mutants grew up through the lawn and were counted after four days incubation at 37c
 
to determine the extent of uvinduced mutagenesis cells that had been irradiated with twenty jm2 uv were used for analysis this uv dose was chosen since even the uvsensitive strains exhibited minimal cell killing at this exposure these conditions therefore provide a window to observe uvinduced mutagenesis without the complications associated with differential levels of cell killing in the various strains the uvinduced mutation frequencies were calculated as previously described 60 this equation not only takes into account the number of mutants spontaneously arising on the low histidine plates but also any effect of reduced cell viability on the number of preexisting his mutants in the culture the data reported in figure four represent the average number of his mutants from three separate experiments  standard error of the mean sem

to assess the possibility of shep and modmdg422 binding mutually exclusively to suhw sites we created an nm binary matrix of binding sites where n  eight thousand one hundred and ninetyfour is the number of binding sites containing any of suhw shep or modmdg422 using the pybedtoolscontribplottingbinaryheatmap function and m  three for the three factors we then took the set of one thousand three hundred and fiftysix suhw sites with shep modmdg422 or both and extracted the shep and modmdg422 vectors for these sites representing a total of six hundred and sixtythree shepsuhw and nine hundred and sixtyfour modmdg422suhw sites there were two hundred and seventyone shepmodmdg422 colocalization events in these vectors we then randomly shuffled the vectors 10000 times computing colocalization each time and obtained a mean of four hundred and seventytwo colocalization events with no iteration giving less than four hundred and thirtyeight colocalization events therefore of the suhw sites containing either shep or modmdg422 the actual shepmodmdg422 overlap of two hundred and seventyone suggests shep modmdg422 and suhw colocalize significantly less often than expected empirical p1104 these results are also consistent with a hypergeometric test using n  1356 n1  663 n2  964 and m  two hundred and seventyone p  221016
 
the same analysis was performed for one thousand four hundred and three modmdg422 sites with suhw shep or both as well as nine hundred and sixtyfour modmdg422suhw and seven hundred and ten modmdg422shep extracted sites the mean of randomized iterations was four hundred and eightyeight and none had less than four hundred and fiftyfour colocalization events empirical p1104 and p  221016 hypergeometric test
 
for one thousand one hundred and two shep sites with suhw modmdg422 or both as well as seven hundred and ten shepmodmdg422 and six hundred and sixtythree shepsuhw extracted sites the mean of randomized iterations was four hundred and twentyseven and none had less than three hundred and ninetythree colocalization events empirical p1104 and p  221016 hypergeometric test

a total of four thousand and fiftyfive study subjects 1405 npc cases and two thousand six hundred and fifty controls table s3 were recruited in two independent collection phases phase i april two thousand to june two thousand and one and phase iinovember two thousand and four to october 2005 from the guangxi autonomous region and guangdong province of southern china 20 all study subjects were of han ethnic origin and reside in the catchment area of the xijiang river iga antibodies to ebv capsid antigen ebvigavca were confirmed by serologic testing for all the subjects at the time of study enrollment in phase i the case group included three hundred and fiftysix unrelated patients with biopsyconfirmed npc the mean age was fifty point one years range 1980 955 of them were ebvigavca antibody positive controls included case spouses or geographically matched residents who were npc free at the time of study enrollment an additional four hundred and twentytwo adult children of the study subjects were enrolled for haplotype inference and for quality control assessment but they were excluded in association analyses in phase ii the case group included one thousand and fortynine unrelated patients with biopsyconfirmed npc the mean age was fortysix point three years range 1077 963 of them were ebvigavca antibody positive two distinct npcfree control groups were included one group was positive n  1001 and the other negative n  1020 for the ebvigavca antibody the mean ages were fortysix point one and 466 for the antibody positive and negative controls groups all study subjects were selfreported guangxi or guangdong provincial ancestry for either maternal or paternal ancestry for at least three generations
 
a total of five hundred and ninetyeight npc cases and five hundred and six controls were randomly selected from phase ii enrollment cohort for gwas analysis dna was extracted from whole blood by traditional phenolchloroform method with phase lock gel tube qiagen maxtract high density catalog  129065 the genomewide genotyping experiments were conducted by using the affymetrix genomewide snp array six point zero genotyping platform three hundred and twentyfive nanograms of dna per sample were prepared for both sty1 and nsp1 restriction enzyme digestion for this assay genotyping in according to the manufacturers instructions
 
genotyping analysis of gwas samples was performed in genotyping console 302 for firstpass quality control the contrast quality control cqc metrics were computed by the affymetrix software we attempted to ascertain genotypes for 1104 npc study subjects eleven samples failed genotyping or were removed because of failing cqc 04 or call rate 90 an additional seventeen samples failed to meet further qc filters which included heterozygosity   25 and at least one enzyme specific cqc value nsp1 or sty1 1 twentyfour samples were removed because the genotypes determined in the gwas were discordant with genotypes previously determined by the laboratory of genomic diversity for candidate gene studies the gender of the samples was determined from the heterozygosity of x chromosome snps affymetrix and plink software and by the ratio of the mean intensity of the copy number probes on the y chromosome to the mean intensity of a subset of copy number probes on the x chromosome affymetrix software four samples were removed because the gender determined from the genotypes was discordant with the gender provided by the cohort identity by descent ibd statistics computed using plink software were used to detect cryptic familial relationships four first degree relationships were observed 3 full sib pairs and one parentoffspring pair for each of these pairs the sample with the lowest call rate was removed a fifth sample was removed because the ibd statistics were consistent with that individual having a first cousin relationship with five other subjects after sample filtering a number of one thousand and fortythree subjects were remained for further analyses table s2
 
genotypes were ascertained for the 934968 snps on the genomewide snp six point zero platform using the command line option of affymetrix software netaffx version thirty was used for snp annotation this data set uses map positions based on the ncbi build 361ucsc hg18 human genome assembly unsupported snps qc snps nonautosomal snps and remaining redundant snps were identified from the annotation data set and removed genotypes from eight ceph and ten npc motherfatheroffspring trios were checked for errors in mendelian inheritance using plink software snps having two or more errors in either group of samples were rejected persnp call rate hardyweinberg test statistics and minor allele frequencies were computed for 1043 npc study samples see table s2a using plink software snps not meeting the criteria shown in the table were removed table s2b
 
validation and replication genotyping of significant snps from our gwas and from other studies was performed using the abi taqman genotyping assays by design in accordance with the manufacturers instructions the sequence detection software sds22 applied biosystems foster city ca usa was used for allelic discrimination and confirmed the good quality of genotyping
 
high resolution hla molecular typing was performed for all 1405 unrelated npc cases and 2650 unrelated controls from both enrollment cohorts hla class i alleles were characterized using a pcrssop sequencespecific oligonucleotide probe typing protocol developed by the 13th international histocompatibility workshop 32 for the first enrollment study cohort n  985 and using a dna sequencebased typing sbt protocol in the second enrollment study cohort n  3070 the sequencing analysis was performed using the abi big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and the abi3730xl dna analyzer applied biosystems foster city ca hla alleles were assigned on the basis of the sequence database of known alleles with the help of the assign software developed by conexio genomics conexio genomics western australia australia ambiguous heterozygous genotypes were resolved by additional pcr and sequencing procedures using allelespecific pcr primers to selectively amplify only one of the two alleles
 
haplotype of hlaa hlab and hlac allelic combinations were assessed using four hundred and twentytwo children of the phase i study subjects in one hundred and seventynine patients and three hundred and seventynine controls based on expectation maximization algorithm to generate maximum likelihood estimation haplotype we observed 90 accuracy on hlaabc haplotypes 91 on hlaab and hlaac haplotypes and 99 on hlabc haplotypes for the remaining npc cases and controls hla haplotypes were assigned by populationbased estimation methods of proc haplotype in sasgenetics package
 
because the most significant npc associated snps is located on the hla class i region see results an amino acid analysis was carried out to evaluate the role of functional relative amino acid residues in hla associations from our high resolution hla genotyping results we were able to define corresponding amino acid sequences for all study subjects the amino acid variants in hla class i genes were defined by using webbased software of the immunology database and analysis portal immport system 24
 
we have used the method of testing each variant for reducedpvalues in multivariants models resulting from colinearity of variants to recognize ld and independence of signals in the association of npc with hlaa b and c multicollinearity in logistic regression models is a result of strong correlations between variables the existence of multicollinearity high r2 between variants inflates the variances of the parameter estimates that will likely result in lowered pvalues for a given snp that was determined to be in significant association with npc when tested signally we used a reduction in significance as an indicator that two variants were in strong ld and therefore not independent signals as has been done by recent authors 18 this gives us a general idea about independence of the signals within hla and adjacent genes within the context of the disease association however we recognize that although multicollinearity may lower magnitudes of regression coefficient estimates and resulting pvalue significance in cases of ld this method may be subject to error such as when a rare snp on a haplotype does not have a large effect on the model these methods are provided as an indicator of independence but not as a definitive measure in our understanding of the disease
 
we performed logistic regression model analysis for all snps passing the quality control filters using a cochranarmitage trend codominant dominant recessive and allelic model taking the number of copies of the rare allele 0 one or 2 as the explanatory variable the comparisons were conducted between npc cases and npc free controls npc cases and npcfree but ebvigavca antibody positive controls ep controls npc cases and npcfree but ebvigavcaantibody negative controls en controls ep controls and en controls respectively population structurestratification was assessed using the principal components analysis pca module of eigensoft software 33 study samples were first run together with hapmap individuals of european african and asian descents to identify any potential admixed individuals later pca analyses of only the study samples were conducted initially all autosomal snps that passed the quality control filters were used to estimate the contribution of each snp to the top ten eigenvectors previously reported correlated genome regions 19 such as on chromosomes 6 8 and 11 were observed and excluded from the following pca analyses moreover to avoid any confounders due to ld among the snps the genotype data was pruned to ninety k independent snps distributed throughout the genome by plink prior to the pca analyses the logistic regression analysis performed using plink 25 controlling for gender age and the first three eigenvectors the significance was evaluated using the log likelihood test snps were sorted according to the lowest pvalue in a combined set of samples in one of these models the chisquare tests were used for testing casecontrol association for allele effects hla allele frequencies were calculated based on observed genotypes hlaa b and c haplotype were assigned based on maximum likelihood estimation using the sasgenetics haplotype procedure the effect of hla alleles on the development of npc and ebvigavca antibody was evaluated by computing odds ratios or and 95 confidence intervals ci using logistic regression for hla allele and haplotype test p values were calculated by logistic regression and then corrected by the bonferroni which was multiplied by the number of all detected alleles or haplotypes significance was considered at p005 after correction

nineteen independent studies contributed to our analyses all study protocols were approved by the respective local institutional review boards and written informed consent for genetic studies was obtained from all participants included in our analyses
 
of the nineteen studies contributing to our analyses eighteen studies came from the charge 8 55 or spirometa 9 consortium age gene environment susceptibility ages  reykjavik study 56 atherosclerosis risk in communities aric study 57 british one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight birth cohort b58c 58 coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia 59 60 cardiovascular health study chs 61 european community respiratory health survey ecrhs 62 european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic obese cases and populationbased subsets 63 framingham heart study fhs 64 65 health aging and body composition health abc study 66 northern finland birth cohort of one thousand nine hundred and sixtysix nfbc1966 67 68 multiethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa 69 70 rotterdam study rsi rsii and rsiii 71 swiss study on air pollution and lung diseases in adults sapaldia 72 study of health in pomerania ship 73 and twinsuk 74 we reached out to other populationbased studies with gwas genotyping and data available on cigarette smoking and pulmonary function resulting in the inclusion of lifelines 75 given the greater power needed to detect novel genetic loci with subtle geneenvironment interaction regardless of the statistical method used 16 we chose to maximize statistical power to discover novel genetic loci by combining all available participants and to use the regression coefficients across the many different component studies as evidence for consistency this approach was similarly taken by another largescale gwas consortium for discovering snp main effects 24
 
all studies were included in our previous gwas metaanalysis of pulmonary function or the followup replication analyses wherein their pulmonary function testing protocols were described 10 for studies with spirometry at a single visit b58c lifelines mesa nfbc1966 ship rsi rsii and rsiii we analyzed fev1fvc and fev1 measured at that visit for studies with spirometry at more than one visit we analyzed measurements from the baseline visit ages aric cardia chs ecrhs epic obese cases epic populationbased health abc and sapaldia or the most recent examination with spirometry data fhs and twinsuk
 
smoking history current past and neversmoking was ascertained by questionnaire at the time of pulmonary function testing packyears of smoking were calculated for current and past smokers by multiplying smoking amount packsday and duration years smoked table s11 presents the specific questions used to ascertain smoking history and packyears in each of the nineteen studies
 
study participants were genotyped on various genotyping platforms and standard quality control filters for call rate hardyweinberg equilibrium pvalue maf and other measures were applied to the genotyped snps table s12 to generate a common set of snps for metaanalysis imputation was conducted with reference haplotype panels from hapmap phase ii subjects of european ancestry ceu table s12 76 imputed genotype dosage values estimated reference allele count with a fractional value ranging from zero to 20 were generated for approximately two point five million autosomal snps among participants with genomewide snp genotyping data exclusions were made due to standard quality control metrics call rate discordance with prior genotyping and genotypic and phenotypic sex mismatch among others missing pulmonary function data or missing covariate data table s13
 
our analyses included 50047 participants from nineteen studies who passed their studyspecific quality control and had complete data on pulmonary function and smoking each study transformed the pulmonary function measures to residuals using linear regression of fev1fvc  and fev1 ml on age age2 sex and standing height as predictors principal component eigenvectors and recruitment site were also included as covariates to adjust for population stratification if applicable the residuals were converted to z scores henceforth referred to as standardized residuals we confirmed that smoking was inversely associated with the fev1fvc and fev1 standardized residuals in all nineteen studies metaanalysis   00030 and corresponding p1106 for packyears of smoking
 
the fev1fvc and fev1 standardized residuals were used as the phenotypes for genomewide association testing with linear regression models which included the following predictor variables imputed snp genotype dosages smoking history dichotomous variable zero  neversmokers and one  eversmokers smoking status dichotomous variable zero  never and pastsmokers and one  currentsmokers packyears of smoking continuous variable and a snpbysmoking interaction product term two of the nineteen studies fhs and twinsuk had much relatedness among participants and we took appropriate account of relatedness in the association testing table s12 four regression models with interaction terms for eversmoking or packyears were specified in relation to standardized residuals for fev1fvc or fev1 as it has long been advised in studying interactions the regression models were designed to fully saturate the main smoking effect on pulmonary function so that the interaction terms do not capture residual main effects 77 in each of the nineteen studies the genomewide analyses were implemented with robust variance estimation using the software packages indicated in table s12
 
our analyses were aimed at finding novel loci associated with pulmonary function when considering an interaction with cigarette smoking so we chose to implement jma of snp main and interactive snpbysmoking effects two df test of the null hypothesis snp  zero and int  0 15 manning et al previously compared the joint methods such as jma with other methods that incorporate geneenvironment interaction such as screening by main effects 78 or conducting a one df metaanalysis of the interaction product term and they found that the joint methods offer optimal statistical power over a range of scenarios for snp main and interactive effects 15 33 therefore our analyses centered on the jma method which simultaneously estimates regression coefficients for the snp and snpbysmoking interaction terms while accounting for their covariance to generate a joint test of significance 15 it also accounts for the unequal variances from studies of different sample sizes secondarily we implemented metaanalyses of just the  coefficient from the interaction term for comparison with the jma results of note the twostep geneenvironment interaction study designs by murcray et al 79 80 and gauderman et al 81 are applicable to casecontrol or caseparent trio studies respectively and were thus not considered for our populationbased studies of continuous traits
 
the jma was conducted with fixed effects on approximately two point five million snps using metal software version 20100208 82 and patch source code provided by manning et al 82 genomic control correction was applied by computing gc as the ratio of the observed and expected 2 df median chisquare statistics and dividing the observed chisquare statistics by gc snps having p jma5108 the standard bonferroniadjusted p value were considered statistically significant 83 further correction for the four different albeit related jma models yielded a conservative p jma threshold of 125108 in addition to reporting the p jma for the most significant snp from each novel locus we used the  and standard error se estimates from the jma results to calculate the p values corresponding to the snp main association p snp and the snpbyeversmoking interaction p int 15
 
gene annotation was performed using the gene prediction tracks ucsc genes and refseq genes in the ucsc browser  the snomirna track from the uscs browser was used to search for any microrna within one hundred kb upstream or downstream of each snp and the tfbs conserved track was used to search for conserved transcription factor binding sites tfbss at or near the most significant snps the snap program 84 was used to infer ld patterns based on the hapmap phase ii ceu population
 
we used separate types of expression analyses to confirm the biologic plausibility of our findings first we carried out mrna expression profiling to show whether or not the implicated genes are expressed in human tissues relevant to pulmonary function the mrna expression profiles of implicated genes were determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr rna was sourced from lung ambionabi human bronchial epithelial cells clonetics 85 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3h biomedica rna from human airway smooth muscle cells cultured as previously described from tissue obtained at thoracotomy 86 was extracted using a commercially available kit qiagen ethical approval for the use of primary cells was obtained from the local ethics committees cdna was generated using one g of rna template using random hexamers and a superscript kit invitrogen as directed by the manufacturer pcr assays were designed to cross intronexon boundaries where possible and where splice variation was known in order to detect all variants the gapdh gene was used as a positive control for the cdna quality and water was used as a negative control primer sequences for the genes of interest are given in table s14 all pcr were done using platinum taq high fidelity invitrogen with one hundred ng of cdna template in a twentyfive l reaction cycling conditions were as follows 94c for two minutes thirtyfive cycles of 94c for fortyfive seconds 55c for thirty seconds and 68c for ninety seconds following pcr gel bands were directly sequenced to confirm the presence of the genes transcript
 
second we used another publically available data repository to investigate whether any of the implicated genes showed evidence for differential expression depending on smoking history the gene expression profiles of human airway epithelium from healthy smokers n  10 and nonsmokers n  12 were obtained from the gene expression omnibus site  27 28 based on robust multichip average processing of probe intensities from affymetrix hgu133 plus two point zero microarrays geo dataset number gse4498 29 mean expression levels of genes around our genomewide significant findings from the jma were compared between smokers versus nonsmokers the p value for the difference in means between smokers and nonsmokers was calculated using the nonparametric mannwhitney test
 
third our genomewide significant snps from novel loci were searched against an expression quantitative trait loci eqtl data repository based on lymphoblastoid cell lines 32 to investigate whether any of the implicated snp variants might influence the expression of the nearby genes p5108 was used to designate statistically significant eqtl associations

the experimental procedure for the dna microarrays experiment was performed as follows adult 0515 years old transgenic zebrafish tgaanat2egfpy8 which express enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp in the pineal gland under the control of the aanat2 regulatory regions were used 29 fish were raised under 12hr light12hr dark ld cycles in a temperature controlled room and transferred to constant darkness dd for tissue collection fish were anesthetized in one point five mm tricane sigma sacrificed by decapitation and pineal glands were removed under a fluorescent dissecting microscope starting from circadian time ct 14 pineal glands were collected at 4hr intervals for fortyeight hours 12 time points identified as ct 14 18 22 2 6 10 14b 18b 22b 2b 6b and 10b pools of twelve dna microarray or twenty rnaseq pineal glands were prepared at each timepoint and total rna was extracted using the rneasy lipid tissue mini kit qiagen according to the manufacturers instructions
 
labeled rna preparation and hybridization to dna microarrays were performed according to the affymetrix manual with the twocycle target labeling protocol  a total of twelve affymetrix dna microarrays were hybridized with rnapools of pineal glands from twelve time points throughout two daily cycles each dna microarray was normalized using affymetrix genechip operating software gcos the entire dna microarray dataset logarithmically transformed was normalized using quantile normalization to guarantee that the distribution of probe intensities was the same in all the chips 59 the microarray data was deposited to the gene expression omnibus geo under accession gse41696
 
illumina truseq protocol was used to prepare libraries from rna samples overall twelve libraries 12 time points were run on two lanes of illumina hiseq2000 machine using the multiplexing strategy of the truseq protocol institute of applied genomics on average 30 million pairedend reads were obtained for each library the reads were 2100 base pairs for eight time points cts 22 2 6 10 18b 2b 6b 10b and 250 base pairs for the remaining time points cts 14 18 14b and 22b tophat 60 was used for aligning the reads against the zebrafish genome allowing only uniquely aligned reads and up to two mismatches per read on average 56 of the reads had unique alignment to the zebrafish genome reads aligned to the protein coding regions of known refseq genes were used a custom script written in perl was used to parse the output of tophat which is given in sequence alignmentmap sam format  and to convert it into raw number of reads aligned to each position in each refseq gene the refseq genes information was obtained from the table browser of the ucsc genome browser genomeucscedu using the zebrafish jul two thousand and ten zv9danrer7 assembly to avoid pcr duplicates only pairedend reads that have unique start position in the genome in both pairs were used 61
 
the quality of the sequencing libraries was assessed as described in levin et al 61 and the data was normalized using quantile normalization text s1 we made sure that the normalization scheme properly corrects for different rna levels and other technical differences between samples text s1 the sequencing data was deposited to the sequence read archive sra under accession sra054264
 
the timedependent signal was converted into a frequencydependent signal using the fast fourier transform fft the extent to which the original signal is circadian was quantified by the ratio gfactor of the power squared amplitude of the frequency which corresponds to twentyfour hr period to the sum of powers of all frequencies 23 the higher the gfactor the higher is the confidence that the transcript is circadian we note that changing the definition of the gfactor by adding the powers of higher harmonics of the twentyfour hr period to the numerator gave similar results compared to the use of the definition above to determine the truepositive rate for a list of transcripts constructed using a given gfactor cutoff permutation analysis was conducted as follows
 
the timedependent signals of each transcript were randomly shuffled
 
fft was performed and gfactor was calculated for each transcript
 
the cumulative histogram of the gfactor values ranging from zero to 1 was calculated resulting in the number of transcripts whose calculated gfactor is larger than a given value random detection function
 
steps 13 were repeated a thousand times and the averaged random detection function was calculated this function estimates the number of falsepositive detections of circadian genes for any given cutoff value of the gfactor
 
steps 23 were performed on the original data set the resulting function providing the number of transcripts exhibiting a gfactor larger than a given value in the real data was termed the detection function
 
for any given choice of cutoff for the gfactor the difference between the detection function and the average random detection function estimates the number of truepositives in the list of transcripts constructed with this cutoff
 
finally using the number of transcripts detected for a given gfactor step 5 and the number of truepositives for a given gfactor step 6 the truepositive rate as a function of the number of transcripts detected was calculated and further used to identify circadian genes with high accuracy figure s8 the procedure described here was implemented using inhouse matlab the mathworks inc script
 
the three hundred and eight circadian refseq genes identified using the rnaseq were analyzed to find overrepresented molecular functions table s2 using the david bioinformatics tools 28 and focusing on overrepresented gene ontology go categories and kegg pathways 62 63 the davids default zebrafish genes background was used all the significantly enriched benjaminihochberg adjusted pvalue005 go categories and kegg pathways are presented in table s5
 
the temporal expression pattern of candidate genes was determined by whole mount ish in zebrafish larvae or by quantitative rtpcr in the adult pineal gland as previously described 12 27 figure s1 and text s1
 
morpholino experiments were conducted as previously described 11 text s1
 
rescue experiments were conducted by coinjection of approximately two nl volume of camk1gb morpholino 1 mm and in vitro transcribed camk1gb mrna 100 ngl the camk1gb proteincoding sequence was pcramplified with a kapa hifi pcr kit kapa biosystems using the same set of primers that was used for ish experiments the pcr products were cloned into a pcs2 vector linearized with noti restriction enzyme and transcribed using the sp6 mmessage mmachine kit ambion according to the manufacturers instructions to generate capped camk1gb mrna
 
embryos were microinjected with either control morpholino camk1gb morpholino or coinjected with camk1gb morpholino and in vitro transcribed camk1gb mrna and kept under ld conditions for three days on the fourth day postfertilization embryos were placed in 48well plates in the observation chamber of the daniovision tracking system noldus information technology and exposed for acclimation to two days under 12hr light 3400 lux12hr dim light 40 lux regime followed by three days of constant dim light live video tracking and analysis was conducted using the ethovision eight point zero software noldus information technology activity was measured at days 68 post fertilization as the distance moved by a larva in ten min time bins figure 4 the activity record of each individual was subjected to fourier analysis and scored with a gfactor see methods section fourier analysis significant differences in the gfactor distributions between the control and camk1gb morpholino treated groups n  75 combining four different experiments as well as between the rescue and camk1gb morpholino treated groups n  16 were determined by the kolmogorovsmirnov test figure 4b and figure 4d the percent of larvae which are considered circadian depends on the gfactor used as the detection criteria but for all values of gfactor cutoff tested ranging between zero point zero five and 03 figure 4d significantly more larvae are considered circadian in the control group
 
to determine whether camk1gb knockdown impairs larval movement abilities locomotor activity levels were tracked under abrupt light to dark transitions 34 on day six post fertilization control morpholino and camk1gb morpholino injected larvae n  24 were subjected to three dark flashes of five sec each during the light phase 34 activity was measured as the distance moved by each larva during the dark flash no statistical difference was observed between the activity of the control morpholino and camk1gb morpholino injected groups students ttest pvalue02 figure s4 indicating that the camk1gb morpholino does not impair larval movement abilities
 
transient cotransfection of the pac2 cell line with camk1gb and per1bluciferase constructs was performed as previously described 64 figure s6 and text s1
 
for double fluorescence ish we followed the protocol of machluf and levkowitz 65 text s1

for aric hypergen gennet and whi bmi was calculated from height and weight measured at time of study enrollment in mec selfreported height and weight were used to calculate baseline bmi a validation study within mec has shown high validity of selfreported height and weight specifically this study showed that bmi was underestimated based on selfreported compared to measured weight but the difference was small 1 bmi unit and comparable to the findings from national surveys 45
 
snps were included as part of the metabochip a two hundred k illumina customized iselect array developed through the collaborative efforts of several consortia working on metabolic syndrome related diseases details on the design can be found elsewhere  in brief snps within the 16q122fto region were selected based on one thousand genomes pilot one and hapmap phase two point the boundaries around each gwas index snp were determined by identifying all snps with r205 with the index snp and then expanding the initial boundaries by zero point zero two cm in either direction using the hapmapbased genetic map 46 the total interval size of the 16q122fto region was six hundred and fortysix kb all one thousand genomes pilot one snps obtained from sanger institute august 12 2009 and the broad institute august 11 2009 were considered as potential fine mapping snps unless snp allele frequency was 001 in all three hapmap samples ceu yri and hbcjpt snps were excluded if a the illumina design score was 05 or b there were snps within fifteen bp in both directions of the snp of interest with allele frequency of 002 among europeans ceu snps annotated as nonsynonymous essential splice site or stop codon were included regardless of allele frequency design score or nearby snps in the primer
 
samples were genotyped on the metabochip at the human genetics center of the university of texashouston aric gennet and hypergen the university of southern california epigenome center mec and the translational genomics research institute whi each center also genotyped ninety hapmap yri yoruba in ibadan nigeria samples to facilitate crossstudy quality control qc as well as 23 studyspecific blinded replicates to assess genotyping reproducibility genotypes were called separately for each study using genomestudio with the gencall two point zero algorithm samples were called using studyspecific cluster definitions based on samples with call rate 95 aric mec whi or cluster definitions provided by illumina gennet hypergen and kept in the analysis if call rate was 95 we excluded snps with gentrain score 06 aric mec whi or 07 gennet hypergen cluster separation score 04 call rate 095 and hardyweinberg equilibrium p1106 we also excluded snps based on mendelian errors in thirty yri trios 1 replication errors 2 with discordant calls when comparing across studies in ninety yri samples 3 and discordant calls for ninety yri genotyped in page versus hapmap database 3 in total we successfully genotyped 1694 out of 1818 variants in the 16q122fto region after excluding one hundred and sixtyfive snps that were monomorphic or had very low allele frequency 001 we included 1529 variants in the analysis
 
for aric mec and whi we identified related persons using plink by estimating identicalbydescent ibd statistics for all pairs when apparent firstdegree relative pairs were identified we excluded from each pair the member with the lower call rate we excluded from further analysis samples with an inbreeding coefficient f above zero point one five aric mec whi 47 we determined principal components of ancestry in each study separately using eigensoft 48 49 and excluded apparent ancestral outliers from further analysis as described elsewhere 50 in total two hundred and forty subjects failed genotyping aric  27 gennet  9 hypergen  26 mec  140 and whi  27 after further excluding subjects based on age and bmi see above a total of 14162 subjects with metabochip data were included 3297 from aric five hundred and seventeen from gennet 1171 from hypergen 3865 from mec and 5312 from whi in addition we included 6326 whi participants genotyped as part of the snp health association resource share on the affymetrix six point zero platform details can be found elsewhere 51
 
to impute to the one thousand genomes project we used as the reference panel the haplotypes of the one thousand and ninetytwo samples all populations from release version two of the one thousand genomes project phase i ftpftptracencbinihgov1000genomesftprelease20110521 52 combining reference data from all populations has been found to improve imputation accuracy of the lowfrequency variants 53 and hence is recommended we built the target panel by combining all genotype data in the fto region from all studies we used genotyped data from the metabochip for all studies except for whi snp health association resource share n  6326 samples where we used genotype data from the affymetrix six point zero platform the target panel was phased using beagle 54 we then performed a haplotypetohaplotype imputation to estimate genotypes as allele dosages at one thousand genomes project variants the phased target panel was imputed to the interval 535542 mb on chromosome sixteen of the one thousand genomes reference panel using minimac 55 to evaluate the quality of each imputed snp we calculated rsq we excluded imputed snps with rsq09 for snps with allele frequency 05 rsq08 for snps with allele frequency 051 rsq07 for snps with allele frequency 13 rsq06 for snps with allele frequency 35 and rsq05 for snps with allele frequency 5 given the large reference panel this resulted in high imputation quality 51 to calculate pairwise correlation between variants we used the one thousand genomes project data specifically we used sixtyone african americans from the southwest asw and sixtyfive european americans utah residents with northern and western european ancestry from the ceph collection ceu
 
the association between each snp and natural logtransformed bmi lnbmi was estimated using linear regression snp genotypes were coded assuming an additive genetic model ie 0 1 or two copies of the coded allele all analyses were adjusted for age continuous sex and study site as applicable all models except whi included sexage interaction terms to account for possible effect modification by sex in addition we adjusted for the top two principal components of ancestry family data from gennet and hypergen was analyzed using mixed models variance component models to account for relatedness
 
results  and ses for lnbmi were combined with fixedeffects metaanalysis weighting the effect size estimates coefficients by their estimated standard errors using metal 56 we evaluated qstatistic and i2 as a measure of heterogeneity 57 58 to describe the presence or absence of excess variation between the page cohorts for ease of interpretation we calculated the  change in bmi per copy of the effect allele based on the beta for the lnbmi to graphically display the results we used locuszoom 59 we tested for independence of findings by including the most significant variant and each of the other variant into the same model ie we included two variants simultaneously in one model we evaluated if snps are independent by investigating the pvalue for an independent snp the pvalue would remain lowsimilar after adjusted for the most significant snp
 
we conducted a bioinformatic characterization for the most significant snp and all snps correlated with the most sigificant snp r205 we implemented inhouse perl scripts to query bioinformatic databases and assigned each of the sixteen snps to one or more of the functional annotation datasets listed in table s3 these datasets are not mutually exclusive for example a snp can be located within both a candidate regulatory element dataset 7 and a ctcf binding site dataset 10 because fto is expressed and may have functional relevance in a wide array of tissues we defined candidate cisregulatory elements dataset 7 as dnasei hypersensitive sites open chromatin loci that are present in at least one human cell type for snps that occur within predicted transcription factor binding sites datasets 3 and 8 we computed transcription factor binding affinity for each snp allele using the pwmscan algorithm 60 as described previously 61

the association panel consisted of sixtysix diverse switchgrass populations grown from seed in the greenhouse of the usdaars dairy forage research center in madison wi in two thousand and seven point this panel was mainly composed of northern adapted upland populations table s1 in addition two tetraploid f1 linkage populations were propagated at the same time one was derived from the biparental cross of two upland accessions from the germplasm collection of mdc named u518 and u418 the other was a halfsib population whose maternal parent is u601 the numbers of individuals in these two populations were one hundred and thirty and 168 respectively for the association panel ten clones from each population were initially planted in replicated field plots in ithaca ny and arlington wi in two thousand and eight point all genotyping was conducted on plants from the ithaca site
 
the reduced representation libraries were constructed and sequenced according to the published gbs protocol 4 with one modification specifically a titration experiment showed that 01 pmol of each adapter was appropriate for switchgrass rather than 006 pmol and that amount was used with one hundred ng of genomic dna dna samples were digested with the restriction enzyme apeki which has a four point five bp cut site cgwgc where w  a or t the resulting libraries were sequenced on the illumina hiseq two thousand point ninety five samples plus a blank negative control were sequenced per lane
 
the nonreference pipeline uneak  was developed for snp discovery and genotyping in species like switchgrass figure 1 in uneak illumina reads are trimmed to sixtyfour bp and stored in bit format which greatly reduces the amount of storage space and enables relatively fast computation about 40gb of data from one lane of an illumina hiseq two thousand can be processed to snp genotypes in twenty minutes on a personal computer with two point six seven ghz cpu and eight gb memory more technical details of uneak are described in text s1
 
the network filter is the key step for identifying and removing paralogs the simplest networks reciprocal tag pairs are more likely to be real snps than tag pairs that are part of complicated networks rare tags with read counts below a specified error tolerance rate etr are assumed to result from sequencing error for two tags t1 and t2 with a one bp mismatch and read counts c1 and c2 if c1c1c2etr then t1 is assumed to be a sequencing error of t2 the edges connecting real tags and error tags are then sheared dividing the network complexes into parts remaining reciprocal real tag pairs are then identified as snps figure s1
 
according to the frequency distribution of tag pairs in structured populations figure 2a and figure s2c we found the frequencies of most sequencing errors were less than 3 therefore the etr was specified as zero point zero three in this study
 
to calculate the coverage in the snp data sets we calculated the sum of the read counts of all of the sites across all the individuals this sum is then divided by the number of sites and number of individuals so the measurement of coverage in this study is readssiteindividual
 
the maternal and paternal parents of the fullsib linkage population u518 and u418 were sequenced via gbs at about 6 ie at six times higher coverage than the f1 individuals in the fullsib population snp markers that were homozygous in one parent and heterozygous in the other and which had a minor allele frequency maf in the progeny between zero point two and zero point three were chosen for linkage analysis via the pseudotestcross mapping approach 27 figure s7 we selected two sets of 3000 markers for paternal and maternal linkage groups respectively
 
initial linkage groups were constructed based upon the 6000 markers with the highest call rate 09 the mmc method 25 was used to cluster the markers into linkage groups in the mmc input file homozygous genotypes were assigned a value of zero or 2 and heterozygous genotypes and missing data were assigned a value of one point spearmans rank correlation coefficient was used by mmc
 
markers representing the cross of aaaa segregate from either a paternal or maternal linkage group using the thirtysix linkage groups produced by mmc from these initial 6000 markers as seeds 88217 markers 012maf038 call rate 05 were then assigned to linkage groups based upon their spearmans rank correlation coefficient to each seed linkage group
 
to order the markers within each linkage group we relied upon extensive synteny between the switchgrass and foxtail millet genomes markers were mapped to the foxtail millet genome  via basic local alignment search tool blast 56 with a pvalue cutoff of 1e5 the 7245 markers that mapped to a single site of the foxtail millet genome and clustered with one of the syntenic linkage groups of switchgrass were used to construct the synteny based framework linkage maps to construct the high density linkage maps the rest of the 80972 markers were mapped to the framework marker with highest value of spearmans rank correlation coefficient within their assigned linkage groups
 
a pairwise genetic distance matrix between individuals was calculated and an unrooted nj tree constructed using tassel 57 all of the 29221 markers with a call rate greater than zero point five in the diverse populations were used in this analysis to assess the robustness of the topology of the tree five hundred bootstrap replicates were performed using mega 58
 
to address the evolutionary trajectory of upland switchgrass a twostep phylogenetic analysis was performed in the first step foxtail millet was used as an outgroup a nj tree was reconstructed based on the 3144 snps that could be aligned to unique positions in the foxtail millet genome this first step identified the lowland ecotype as ancestral to the remaining switchgrass ecotypes studied herein the second step omitted foxtail millet and used the lowland ecotype as the outgroup this second nj tree was reconstructed based on 29221 markers alignment to foxtail millet not required an mds plot was also generated based upon the kinship matrix of individuals calculated from the 29221 markers in tassel 57

the jgi annotation pipeline was used to annotate c heterostrophus strains c5 and c4 c sativus nd90pr and s turcica for this the assembled genomic scaffolds were masked using repeatmasker 100with the repbase fungal library of two hundred and thirtyfour fungal repeats 101 and genomespecific libraries derived using 102 multiple sets of gene models were predicted for each assembly and automated filtering based on homology and est support was applied to produce a final nonredundant genecatalog representing the best gene model found at each genomic locus the geneprediction methods were estbased predictions with est map  using raw ests and assembled est contigs for each genome homologybased predictions with fgenesh 103 and genewise 104 with homology seeded by blastx alignments of the genbank nonredundant sequence database nr  to the genomic scaffolds and ab initio predictions using fgenesh 103 and genemark 105 genewise models were extended to include 5 start andor 3 stop codons when possible additional estextended sets were generated using blataligned 106 est data to add 5 utrs 3utrs and cds regions that were supported by ests but had been omitted by the initial prediction methods
 
all genome annotations can be interactively accessed through mycocosm 107 
 
because the subject genomes are all closely related to the fully sequenced reference c heterostrophus strain c5 additional c heterostrophus field strains hm540 hm338 and pr1x412 c victoriae c carbonum and c miyabeanus were resequenced using using illumina technology dna was randomly sheared into 200 bp fragments using covaris e210 according to the manufacturers recommendation and the resulting fragments were used to create an illumina library 276 bp reads were assembled using velvet version 1104 97 there are no ests available for these organisms assembled contigs were mapped to the reference c heterostrophus c5 for analysis of genome variation and rearrangements assembled reads are called nodes scaffolds overall sequence assembly and annotation statistics are presented in table three point
 
the genomes without jgi annotation pipeline gene predictions chhm540 chhm338 chpr1x412 c carbonum c miyabeanus c victoriae were annotated using augustus 108
 
assembled genomes were mapped individually to the c5 reference strain using the nucmer program of mummer v three point two two 46 a program that finds unique exact matches to build whole genome alignments snps were called and analyzed using the dnadiff wrapper on the filtered mummer delta files unassembled reads were also aligned to the c heterostrophus c5 reference genome for low coverage analysis using maq071 regions of the reference genome under a depth of three aligned reads were considered low coverage for our analyses adjacent low coverage regions were merged if they were separated by less than one hundred bp in order to minimize noise from mismapping of occasional low quality reads after low coverage regions were identified for pairwise comparisons to c5 regions were identified that were shared as low coverage in multiple genomes ie c carbonum c victoriae c miyabeanus and c sativus for c heterostrophus specific regions c heterostrophus hm540 hm338 and pr1x412 for c strain specific regions and c4 hm338 and pr1x412 for race o specific regions
 
cross genome comparisons were visualized using mauve 44 a multiple genome alignment tool that visualizes localized collinear blocks lcb between genomes
 
cloned rflp markers 8 were sequenced and sequences used in blast queries against the c heterostrophus c5 assembly top hits were filtered using bioperl and manually confirmed to span the entire rflp with very high stringency to rule out markers that might exist as more than one copy physical and genetic distances of adjacent rflps mapping to the same scaffold were plotted and used to calculate an average ratio of physical to genetic distance figure s1 table s2 relative rflp location was used to orient scaffolds along the linkage group when possible
 
a genetic linkage map was generated previously using the mapping population derived from a cross between parental isolates nd931 and nd90pr 30 and amplified fragment length polymorphism aflp and rflp markers to add simple sequence repeat ssr markers to the map the draft sequence assembly of the c sativus isolate nd931 was screened for ssr loci with di and trinucleotide units tandemly repeated six or more times using a perl script provided by zheng jin tu at the university of minnesota st paul the ssrcontaining sequences from nd931 were aligned to the draft genome sequence of isolate nd90pr of c sativus only those sequences that were polymorphic between the two c sativus parents nd931 and nd90pr were used for primer design and tested for segregation in the mapping population used previously 30 pcr conditions and detection of ssr markers were as previously described 109 map construction was performed by using mapmaker version two point zero 110 a minimum lod value of four point zero and a maximum theta of zero point three were used to group all ssr markers with previously mapped aflp rflp and pcr markers 30 the kosambi mapping function was used to calculate the map distance
 
to associate linkage groups to the sequenced scaffolds of c sativus the sequences of mapped ssr markers were used as queries to blast against the draft genome assembly of c sativus isolate nd90pr and the coordinates of each ssr marker were recorded for the associated scaffold
 
nrps and pks proteins were identified using our custom fungal amp domain model 57 for the former and an hmm model build from c heterostrophus ks domains plus sequences from the cterminal and nterminal ketosynthase ks pfam domains for the latter pf00109 and pf02801 proteins were identified in two ways in the first case genome nucleotide sequences were searched using genewise 111 and sequences extracted and concatenated by a perl script utilizing bioperls searchio system 112 in the second case augustus protein models see above and jgi protein models c heterostrophus c sativus s turcica were searched with the pks ks and nrps amp hmm using hmmer three point zero 113 and the sequences extracted and concatenated using a perl script with bioperls searchio
 
amp and ks domains were aligned separately with mafft  and manually inspected to remove columns of poor alignment prottest 114 was run on both alignments and identified the rtrevf model as the best fit for the amp domains and the wagf model as the best fit for the ks domain alignments respectively raxml 115 using the rtrevf and wagf models with a gamma distribution was used to infer maximum likelihood trees and bootstrap support was determined using the fastbootstrap method with one thousand bootstrap replicates 116 the cipres portal  was used for inference of phylogenetic trees

we refer to the standard laboratory yeast sequence 6264 as the reference sequence two common sequence polymorphs found within the wild population were used the first with deletion of nineteen amino acids from residues sixtysix to eightyfour and the g162d change is referred to as 19 and the other includes n109s g162d d169e p186a t206k h225d and is denoted e9 20 a prion originating with the sup35p sequence of strain e9 for example but being propagated in a strain expressing only the reference sequence will be designated psi e9ref in analogy with similar nomenclature for ure3 31 cytoductants see below generated with strain a as donor and strain b as recipient are denoted ab they have the nuclear genotype of strain b and the cytoplasmic genotype of both a and b in an abuse of language we often use psi e9ref was transferred to sup35 19 to mean psi e9ref was transferred to cells expressing sup35 19
 
sup35p is a subunit of the translation termination complex and the incorporation of a large proportion of sup35p into the prion amyloid filaments makes it inactive resulting in increased readthrough of termination codons this is measured by readthrough of ade21 with an ochre termination codon in the middle of the ade2 gene in addition to ade21 strains carry the suq5 weak suppressor mutation which leaves cells ade unless the psi  prion is also present 2
 
the strains used are listed in table s1 plasmids used containing reference 19 or e9 sequences were generated as described 20 all yeast media and plates contained twenty m copper sulfate unless noted rich and minimal media ypad and sd are as described 65 only nutrients required by the strains used in a given experiment were added to minimal plates
 
cytoplasm may be transferred from one strain to another utilizing the kar11 mutation 66 defective for nuclear fusion cells fuse but the nuclei do not fuse and nuclei separate at the next cell division however cytoplasmic mixing has occurred and so a genetic element prion or mitochondrial dna present in one strain identified by its nuclear genotype will be transferred to the other we use transfer of mitochondrial dna as a marker of cytoplasmic transfer and score prion transfer reference 19 or e9 sequence plasmids were transformed into both laboratory strains four thousand eight hundred and twentyeight and 4830 loss of p1215 ura3 sup35c was selected by growth on 5fluoroorotic acid media and ade transformants were made rho by growth on ypad containing one mgml ethidium bromide donor and recipient strains at high density were mixed in water at a ratio of about 51 and the mixture was spotted onto a ypad plate after eighteen hours at room temperature the mating mix was streaked for single colonies on media selective against growth of the donor strain clones are shown to be cytoductants by their growth on glycerol and failure to grow on media selective for diploids as further tests of a sample confirm ade cytoductants are judged to have received and propagated psi 
 
psi  strain 7796a 48 was streaked to single colonies on 12 ypd media and twelve colonies were selected named y1y12 these isolates were streaked to single colonies three additional times each time selecting just one colony for further propagation from the third plate a single colony was selected and expanded on 12 ypd and cells from this plate were used for cytoduction from dilution tests there are approximately 2107 cells per colony indicating a total of at least seventyfive generations of growth of clones y1y12 before cytoduction additional subclones were handled in the same manner with only ten colonies selected from the initial 12 ypd plate in experiments to rule out selection during stationary growth phase subclones of y1 and y2 were grown in a one hundred and twentyfive ml erlenmyer flask containing twentyfive ml of liquid ypd medium when a600 reached 03 the culture was diluted transferring one thousand cells of each to a fresh flask these subclones were propagated in exponential phase for eightyfour generations and were then streaked for single colonies on 12 ypd plates after one day of growth on 12 ypd ten subclones were selected for each of y1 and y2 expanded and tested for transmission via cytoduction
 
strains reported to be psi  49 were obtained from the uc davis department of viticulture and enology culture collection the cultures were first tested to determine if dots were visible using either reference sequence sup35nmgfp pdb65 or e9 sequence sup35nmgfp pdb81 20 images were obtained with a nikon eclipse te2000u spinning disc confocal microscope with 100 na one point four nikon oil lens with 15 magnifier and captured with a hamamatsu emccd imagem digital camera with iplab version 408 wild strains were sporulated and spores were crossed on rich medium with strain four thousand nine hundred and seventytwo selecting g418resistant prototrophs the diploids formed were again sporulated and tetrads were dissected for each wild strain except for strain 978 whose diploid with four thousand nine hundred and seventytwo would not sporulate ade positive segregants were tested for guanidine curing using two successive streaks on ypad with five mm guanidine mat strains were cytoduced into strain four thousand eight hundred and thirty carrying prs316 ura3 for selection lys2 mutants of mata strains were selected on plates with dlaminoadipic acid as a nitrogen source 67 selected strains were retested for ade positive growth and curing and cytoduced into strain four thousand eight hundred and twentyeight point
 
the cytoduction data follows the binomial distribution because each data point expresses two alternative results transmission of psi or failure of its transmission however because of the large number of observations the results should be approximately normally distributed we want to calculate the probability that two sets of data are due to chance let p1 and p2 be the observed proportions of transmission in cytoductions one and 2 and ni the number of cytoductants tested in each experiment let p  p1n1p2n2n1n2 be the average of the proportion of transmission in the two experiments the estimated standard error of the difference between the two proportions isthe null hypothesis is that cytoductions one and two are samples from the same population with transmission efficiency p and standard error s then the expected proportions are expected to be the same and their difference is expected to be zero p1p20s  z  the number of standard deviations that the observed difference in proportions differs from the expected difference 0 the frequency of z being greater or equal to the observed value assuming the null hypothesis is obtained from a table of the normal distribution the calculated p values are shown in the tables and at appropriate points in the text
 
cytoductants examined have been treated as independent since the chance that they represent sister cells is close to zero this is because cytoductant mixtures were incubated at 20c where the cells divide slowly and because only about thirty cells were examined from several million in the zygote mixture on each plate

all human research was approved by the relevant institutional review boards and conducted according to the declaration of helsinki
 
cohort description genotyping and statistical methods for individual study cohorts are reported in text s1 and table s1
 
we carried out a metaanalysis including up to 26523 individuals from eighteen cohorts for tsh and up to 17520 individuals from fifteen cohorts for ft4 see table 1 ft4 measures were not available for all 21955 individuals with tsh levels of the fifteen participating cohorts we combined evidence of associations from single gwas using an inverse variance metaanalysis where weights are proportional to the squared standard error of the beta estimates as implemented in metal 57 prior to gwas each study excluded individuals with known thyroid pathologies taking thyroid medication who underwent thyroid surgery and with outofrange tsh values 04 miul and 4 miul and an inverse normal transformation was applied to each trait table s1 age agesquared and gender were fitted as covariates as well as principal components axes or additional variables as required table s1 familybased correction was applied if necessary see table s1 uniform quality control filters were applied before metaanalysis including maf 001 call rate 09 hwe p1106 for genotyped snps and low imputation quality defined as r203 or info 04 if mach 58 or impute 59 60 were used respectively for imputed snps
 
genomic control was applied to individual studies if lambda was 10 the overall metaanalysis showed no significant evidence for inflated statistics lambda for tsh ft4 and were one point zero five and one point zero three respectively to evaluate for heterogeneity in effect sizes across populations we used a chisquare test for heterogeneity implemented in metal 57 the same test was used to evalute heterogeneity related to iodine intake by comparing effect sizes obtained in a metaanalysis of studies assessing individuals from south europe inchianti micros val borbera sardinia totaling up to 7488 subjects with those estimated in a metaanalysis of studies assessing individuals from north america blsa chs fhs ooa totaling up to 5407 subjects finally the main metaanalysis was carried out independently by two analysts who obtained identical results
 
to identify independent signals each study performed gwa analyses for both tsh and ft4 by adding the lead snps found in the primary analysis 19 for tsh and four for ft4 see table 2 as additional covariates to the basic model and removing those from the test data set when lead snps were not available the best proxies r208 were included we then performed a metaanalysis on the conditional gwas results using the same method and filters as described above we used the standard genomewide significance cutoff p5108 to declare a significant secondary association
 
to identify sexspecific effects each study performed gwa analyses for each gender separately using the same covariates and transformation as in the basic model with the exception of gender covariate we then performed a metaanalysis on association results using the same method and filters described for the primary analysis to evaluate sexspecific differences we tested heterogeneity between effect sizes as described above falsediscovery rates fdrs on the twentysix associated snps were calculated with rs padjust procedure via the method of benjamini and hochberg 24
 
the variance explained by the strongest associated snps was calculated for each trait and in each cohort as the difference of r2 adjusted observed in the full and the basic models where the full model contains all the independent snps in addition to the covariates the estimates from each cohort were combined using a weighted average with weights proportional to the cohort sample size
 
to evaluate the impact of the detected variants with clinically relevant tsh levels we compared the allele frequencies observed in different categories of individuals in a casecontrol approach specifically we compared individuals in the upper and lower tsh tails individuals with tsh 4 miul and tsh 04 miul respectively whom were excluded for the gwas analyses as well as individuals in each tail with those in the normal tsh range in the first case individuals in the lower tail were considered controls and those in the upper tail cases in the other two cases we defined individuals in the normal range as controls and individuals on the two tails cases to avoid sources of bias individuals taking thyroid medication andor with thyroid surgery were excluded only unrelated individuals were selected from the familybased cohort sardinia while gee correction was applied to the twinsuk dataset results from single cohorts were then metaanalyzed we first assessed the global impact of the twenty tsh and six ft4associated variants by defining a genotyperisk score grs for each individual as the weighted sum of tsh and ft4elevating alleles with weights proportional to the effect estimated in the metaanalysis for each comparison we then calculated quartiles from the global distribution casescontrols of the genotype score and used quartile one as the baseline reference to compare the number of cases and controls in the other quartiles in addition for tshassociated variants we conducted single snp comparisons grs quartile and single snp analyses were performed by each study separately cohort specific results were then metaanalyzed for both the grs score and single snp results only if they had at least fifty cases and fifty controls specifically cohorts included were chs lifelines prosper rs sardinia and twinsuk
 
bivariate analysis was carried out with the software poly 26 in the sardinia cohort using the same individuals included in the gwas and considering the same covariates and transformation for tsh and ft4 levels

the association panel consists of two hundred and eightytwo diverse maize lines that have been previously described 42 these lines can be subdivided into five major subpopulations namely stiff stalk nonstiff stalk tropical or semitropical lines related to the nonstiff stalk lines sweet corn and popcorn the association panel includes the twentyfive founder lines of the nam population the maize nam population consists of 5000 rils recombinant inbred lines derived from crossing b73 with twentyfive diverse maize inbred lines and then selfing for five generations 43
 
phenotypic data were collected from the nam population and the two hundred and eightytwo association panel grown in eight environments including ithaca ny clayton nc champaign il and colombia mo during the summers of two thousand and six and two thousand and seven point flowering time was measured separately for female flowers number of daystosilk and male flowers daystoanthesis from the day of planting the flowering date was defined as the day when the anthers or silk were visible on 50 of all plants within a row
 
dna sequence data were obtained for d8 from thornsberry et al 2001 available at ncbi primers were designed for pcr amplification of gene fragments of interest from the two hundred and eightytwo lines in the association panel
 
each pcr product was cleaned by treating the samples with exonuclease exoi and shrimp alkaline phosphatase sap and incubated at 37c for three min followed by 80c for ten min the samples were prepared for sequencing using a mixture with a total volume of ten l containing zero point seven l forward primer zero point seven l reverse primer 5 pmoll zero point five l big dye terminator one point seven l 5 sequencing buffer seven point one l distilled water and the pcr product the thermal cycler was set on the following program initial denaturation at 96c for four min followed by thirty cycles at 96c for ten sec 50c for five sec and 60c four min with a final incubation at 10c sanger3730xl dna sequencing was performed using an applied biosystems automated three thousand seven hundred and thirty dna analyzer the software biolign alignment and multiple contig editor with codon code phredphrap analysis was used for alignment using consensus sequence contigs and sequence quality scores
 
the alignments from ncbi were also used to reanalyze the results published in the initial study by thornsberry et al 2001
 
to obtain sequence data for the region between d8 and tb1 the same protocol was used as described above however primer sequences were obtained from camuskulandaivelu et al 2008
 
best linear unbiased predictions blups of the lines in the two hundred and eightytwo association panel and the nam population were the same as those reported in buckler et al 2009 these were obtained from a random effects model fitted in asreml version two point zero software 44 that accounts for spatial correlation and field effects
 
tassel trait analysis by association evaluation and linkage was used for data processing analysis 45 and results were confirmed by using sas 46 association between polymorphisms and phenotypes were evaluated using general linear model glm and mixed linear model mlm by incorporating phenotypic and genotypic data population structure q and kinship matrix k
 
population structure was predicted using a bayesian approach that estimates the relationship between subpopulations by grouping genotypic correlations at unlinked markers within the population with the software structure 18 as described in 42 this approach uses the proportion of an individuals genome that originated from each subpopulation to estimate the genetic background matrix q
 
in mlm the familial relatedness between the individuals is taken into consideration through a kinship matrix this model corrects for spurious associations arising from population structure and familial relatedness 47 in this study we used markerbased kinship which was determined on the basis of the definition that random pairs of inbreds are unrelated kinship was calculated using the software package spagedi 48 it has been suggested that marker based kinship is more appropriate for association studies than kinship based on pedigree records 19 40 the same set of markers was used to create the population structure and kinship matrix
 
the glm approach in this study for phenotype y is1where the x term represents the fixed effects including genotypes and population structure q and  is a vector of residual effects following a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and variancecovariance matrix 2 i the naive model is the same as glm without the population structure effect
 
the mlm approach in this study is the same model as used by yu et al two thousand and six point
 
mixed model for phenotype y is2where the x term represents the fixed effects including genotypes and population structure q and the z term represents random line effects including the matrix of kinship coefficients k and vector of polygene background effects  is a vector of residual effects following a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and variancecovariance matrix 2 i
 
genomewide association studies gwas were carried out in the two hundred and eightytwo association panel using 51741 snps obtained from the illumina maizesnp50 beadchip and 591552 snps from the genotyping by sequencing gbs protocol 49 three different approaches that take into account varying degrees of population structure and familial relatedness were undertaken the first approach called the naive approach uses a model similar to the one presented in equation 1 except that the q matrix representing population structure is not included among the fixed effects the next approach is the glm approach which uses the model in equation 1 with the first five principal components pcs of the nonindustry subset of the illumina maizesnp50 beadchip snps 34368 snps included as fixed effects to represent population structure the final approach is the mlm approach with the aforementioned first five pcs representing population structure and a kinship matrix calculated from the nonindustry subset of these snps for the variancecovariance matrix of the random line effects this kinship matrix is calculated using the method of 50 in each approach these models are fitted to each snp after all snps with minor allele frequencies mafs less than zero point zero five are removed from the analysis the benjaminihochberg 51 procedure adjusts for the multiple testing problem by controlling the false discovery rate fdr at 005 this phase of the anlaysis was conducted using the genome association and prediction integrated tool gapit package in the r programming language 52
 
joint linkage mapping of blups for the phenotype across environments was performed using the proc glmselect in sas as described in buckler et al 2009 11 blups were calculated for each phenotype and used together with imputed genetic marker intervals and stepwise regression to identify qtls missing marker data were imputed by utilizing genetic distance between missing and flanking markers a permutation procedure was implemented to obtain empirical   zero point zero five thresholds for including and excluding terms in the joint linkage model 53
 
to calculate the linkage disequilibrium between the snps within d8 tested in this association study against the rest of the genome the ld function sitebyall in the tassel software was used 45 for genotypic data the illumina maizesnp50 beadchip was used as well as 458k gbs genotyping by sequencing snps 49

repetitive dna families in the genome sequences were defined by processing a selfblastn report from each genome using a custom perl script amyotte sg etal manuscript in preparation that identified sequences with multiple genome copies and classified these repeats into nonredundant families the repeat families were then manually curated to correct or remove families misidentified in the automated process above the genome distribution of repeated sequences was characterized using repeatmasker version 329 93 with crossmatch 94 version 0990329 with the final set of repetitive families serving as a custom library results have been included in the gbrowse web sites wwwendophyteukyedu all unique repeats identified from the genome custom libraries were compared by reciprocal blastn to identify conserved sequences within and between each species repeat sequences with blast scores greater than one hundred were used to develop a matrix table of corresponding repeat numbers a common number was given to each repeat association to rapidly identify repeat families conserved across species the matrix table was used to label repeats within each gene cluster with the universal repeat numbers figure 6 figure 7 figure 9 figure 10 figure 11 repeats were assigned to putative superfamilies and families where possible based on blastx analysis and the presence and orientation of terminal repeats table s5
 
miniature inverted repeat transposable elements mites previously characterized in e festucae 67 were identified in other genomes by blastn using a personal database to determine whether short repeats found in nonepichloid clusters were mites they were analyzed for terminal inverted repeats using einverted emboss  individual repeatcontaining loci were aligned using muscle and manually analyzed for evidence of recombination
 
rip indices were calculated using a sliding window analysis with a two hundred bp window and a step size of 20bp in the centromeretotelomere direction rip indices apttpa 95 were calculated for each window the process was repeated until the window met the end of the sequence ie partial windows were not counted these operations were performed automatically using a perl script protocol s1
 
gene predictions were conducted by various methods available in maker version 203 96 in the maker runs assembled contigs were filtered against repbase 97 model organism fungi using repeatmasker 93 version open328 our maker runs used the predictors augustus 231 fusarium model 98 fgenesh 311 fusarium model 99 genemarkes 23a selftrained and snap 20060728 trained with c purpurea gene predictions for genus claviceps and with e festucae e2368 gene predictions for other genera these ab initio predictions were supplemented with evidence from clavicipitaceae proteins in the ncbi nonredundant protein database and from assembled e festucae ests unigenes relationships of predicted proteins to known protein families were assessed by running interproscan 100 on the inferred protein sequences inferred from the predicted genes results including maker and fgenesh predictions and subsequent analyses have been included in a collection of web sites based on gbrowse one point seven zero 101 102 posted at wwwendophyteukyedu
 
gene modeling for c purpurea was done similarly by applying three different gene prediction programs 1 fgenesh 99 with different matrices trained with aspergillus nidulans neurospora crassa and a mixed matrix based on different species 2 genemarkes 103 and 3 augustus 98 with available ests as hints the different gene structures were displayed in gbrowse 101 102 allowing manual validation of all coding sequences cdss annotation was aided by blastx hits between the c purpurea genome and those from blumeria graminis neurospora crassa fusarium graminearum and ustilago maydis respectively for the cluster regions and selected genes of interest the best fitting model per locus was selected manually and gene structures were adjusted by manually splitting them or redefining exonintron boundaries based on est data where necessary
 
orthology analysis was conducted on fgeneshpredicted proteins with length ten amino acids or greater each inferred protein sequence was assigned a unique label with a prefix indicating its source genome the predicted genes were first compared to the curated ortholog groups in orthomcldb 104 version four using the orthomcl web service  to which each predicted proteome was submitted independently next the combined set of inferred proteins from all of the sequenced clavicipitaceae was analyzed as described in the orthomcl algorithm document  the software versions used for this procedure were orthomcl version 202 105 mclbio 100 mcl version 10201  106 and ncbi blast version 2225 107
 
as noted by li et al 105 an orthomclderived ortholog group may contain paralogs as well as orthologs we used the cococl 108 software distribution to recursively divide the ortholog groups obtained from orthomcl into subgroups a division was accepted if it had a bootstrap score of zero point seven five or greater and a splitscore number of taxa common to both subgroups divided by the number of taxa represented in the smaller subgroup of zero point five or greater a high split score indicates that the group is likely to be the result of an ancient duplication event as many taxa have representative protein sequences on both sides of the split for these analyses cococl was slightly modified as follows the multiple aminoacidsequence alignments employed muscle version 3831 106 instead of clustalw version 183 109 because rigorous experiments with simulated protein data sets have shown that muscle is comparable or superior in speed and average accuracy to the best current methods such as clustalw mafft and tcoffee 106 clustalw was still used to compute distance matrices from muscles alignments the remaining calls to clustalw in the cococl source code were converted to noninteractive mode avoiding freezes that can occur when clustalw prompts the user unexpectedly finally we addressed a potential infinite loop generated by the cococl clustering program when a cluster cannot be partitioned into precisely two subclusters in our version this situation terminates the clustering program leaving the cluster unpartitioned
 
results of orthomcl and cococl have been included in the genome browser web sites wwwendophyteukyedu clicking an fgenesh prediction in the browser opens a data page that lists and hotlinks the predictions homologs and orthologs as well as a link to download the multiple sequence alignment for that cluster a patch file is provided in supporting information protocol s2
 
for phylogenetic analysis the following steps were performed on the phylogenyfr site 110 sequences were aligned with muscle 111 the phylogenetic tree was inferred with phyml 112 and branch support was estimated by the approximate likelihoodratio test 113 with the shlike option trees were compared by the shimodairahasegawa test 114 implemented in phangorn 115 with the default parameters and 10000 bootstrap replications
 
sequences of cdna generated by reverse transcription of mrna provided the information required for manual annotation to refine models of alkaloid biosynthesis genes using the qiagen rneasy plant mini kit rna was isolated from symbiota composed of lolium pratense   schedonorus pratensis with e festucae see figure 1d tissues analyzed were newly emerged stromata and preanthesis inflorescences rna quality and quantity was checked on bioanalyzer two thousand one hundred agilent using plant rna nano chip a clone library was constructed by cdna synthesis with the smart kit clontech 116 normalization and cloning into the triplex2 vector clontech transfected e coli bm258 cells were grown with ampicillin to select clones and plasmid dna was isolated and sequenced by standard sanger sequencing using bigdye version three point zero and an applied biosystems life technologies model three thousand seven hundred and thirty xl dna sequencer
 
for deep cdna sequencing rnaseq ten g of high quality total rna was used for cdna library preparation according to the mrna sequencing sample preparation guide illumina cat rs 9301001 sources of rna were inflorescences and stromata of l pratensee festucae symbiota laboratory id numbers two thousand one hundred and ninetyfour and two thousand three hundred and fiftytwo point the libraries were validated on a two thousand one hundred bioanalyzer using a dna1000 chip agilent these libraries were used for bridgepcr sr cluster generation kit v4 illumina and 82cycle singleread sequencing was conducted on a genome analyzer iix illumina in the dna facility at iowa state university
 
rnaseq data from stromata and inflorescences as well as rnaseq data previously obtained from wild type e festucae and a saka mutant 57 were used for genomewide identification and annotation of the expressed proteincoding genes of the epichloe festucae strains the rnaseq data were combined with previously generated rnaseq data and assembled into tac contigs defined as a continuous exonic region with contiguous read coverage on both e2368 and fl1 assemblies by mapsplice 117 which performs both spliced and unspliced alignment of rnaseq reads to the reference genome then the combined read alignment coverage of the six tissues was used to detect exons exon boundaries are determined by splice junctions or the absence of the read coverage two tacs can be merged together by a splice junction connecting them a taccontig is a maximum set of tacs that are linked together by splice junctions if alternative splicing events exist the alternative splice junction with more read alignment support is preferred because intergenic transcription or overlapping transcription of convergent genes sometimes led to merged gene models junctions that crossed two fgenesh genes were filtered out and tac contigs that overlapped with more than two fgeneshpredicted genes were split according to the predicted gene boundaries the 5 and 3 boundaries of gene structures were also trimmed based on the predicted genes
 
all of the genes for ergoline peramine indolediterpene and loline alkaloid biosynthesis as well as genes used for phylogenetic analysis were manually annotated many of the genes were previously characterized in the same or related species and strains by targeted reverse transcription of their mrnas followed by cdna sequencing 21 39 4143 70 71 118121 transcriptome information from e festucae including reads from cloned cdnas and assembled tac contigs was used to model the gene exons crossspecies comparisons for example by using tblastn or tblastx were employed to refine models in species for which transcript data were unavailable in some cases such as the newly discovered easo and easp genes mrna segments were amplified by reversetranscriptionpcr and sequenced
 
blastx and interproscan 100 were employed to identify genes encoding enzymes that are signatures of sm gene clusters in the ascomycota namely nonribosomal peptide synthetases nrps ipr010071 ipr006163 ipr001242 polyketide synthases pks ipr013968 dmatsfamily aromatic prenyltransferases ipr017795 pfam pf11991 and terpene synthasescyclases ipr008949 the probable functions of proteins encoded by nearby genes were similarly assessed as sm gene clusters contain various families of biosynthetic genes including mono and dioxygenases dehydrogenases reductases pyridoxalphosphate plpcofactor enzymes hydrolases prenyltransferases and methyltransferases as well as abc or mfs efflux pumps and transcription regulators however many members of these enzyme families are involved in primary metabolism considering that most clavicipitaceae can grow on minimal salts medium with sugars and inorganic nitrogen those genes that had orthologs identified by cococl among all of the sequenced genomes were considered probable primary metabolism genes this interpretation was validated by the observation that most apparently active sm signature genes were flanked on one or both sides by ortholog groups with limited distribution among the twelve sequenced genomes note that even after cococl analysis nrps and pks ortholog groups usually had several members in each genome making it difficult to discern the distribution of their true orthologs but this was not generally a problem for nearby genes

all study protocols were approved by institutional review boards at their respective sites brief descriptions of the studies are provided in the text s1 general characteristics and measurements of tg hdlc and ldlc in each cohort are summarized in table s1 values of triglycerides were natural log transformed to approximate normality in each study sample separately
 
we genotyped all study samples with the metabochip according to the manufacturers protocol illumina san diego ca usa table s1 summarizes the quality control criteria of genotyping including call rate sample success rate hardyweinberg equilibrium and maf that varied across studies
 
we applied multiple linear regression models and assumed an additive mode of inheritance to test for association between genotypes and hdlc ldlc or logtransformed triglycerides we performed each test of association separately in each of the eleven groups table s1 prior to metaanalysis we constructed principal components pcs using the software eigensoft we used age and sex as covariates in each individual cohort other cohortspecific covariates including age2 enrollment site socioeconomic status and principal components varied across studies table s1 the european samples include type two diabetes t2d cases and unaffected controls to avoid confounding due to t2d status samples were analyzed separately as finnish t2d patients finnish unaffected individuals norwegian t2d patients and norwegian unaffected individuals
 
we first conducted the metaanalysis within the african americans east asians and europeans separately we then performed combined transethnic metaanalyses by combining the statistics of each the eleven participating groups to assess the association with the snps at the fiftyeight lipids loci
 
at loci that exhibited evidence of association at p104 we next performed a series of sequential conditional analyses by adding the most strongly associated snp into the regression model as a covariate and testing all remaining regional snps for association we conducted a set of sequential conditional analyses until the strongest snp showed a conditional p value104 and had no annotation or literature evidence that suggested a functional role
 
for single snp analyses we applied plink  73 for populationbased studies we used the r package gwaf 74 for the familybased study of hypergen we applied an inverse varianceweighted fixedeffect metaanalysis implemented in metal 75
 
unless otherwise noted linkage disequilibrium estimates were obtained from the one thousand genomes project november two thousand and ten release snp positions correspond to hg18
 
we performed haplotype analysis at ldlc locus tomm40apoeapoc4 in 5593 unrelated african americans from the page consortium using the haplostat r package haplotypes and haplotype frequencies were estimated using the r function haploem the association between haplotypes and ldlc was assessed using the r function haploglm an additive model was assumed in which the regression coefficient  represents the expected change in ldlc level with each additional copy of the specific haplotype compared with the reference haplotype which was set as the aa trait increasingincreasing haplotype
 
we created the regional association plots using locuszoom 76 to plot the association results in europeans and east asians we used the locuszoomimplemented ld estimates from the one thousand genomes project june 2010 ceu and chbjpt samples whose ld structures are similar to our samples with european and east asian ancestries we applied the usersupplied ld calculated from the genotype data of the page african american samples to plot the regional association in african americans 9 because the ld patterns may vary from any precomputed ld sources implemented in locuszoom
 
we evaluated the proportion of variance explained by a single snp or any given locus by including the snp or a set of snps into a linear regression model with all covariates used in association analysis and calculating the r2 for the full model we subtracted the variance explained by a basic model in which only covariates were included from the variance we obtained from the full model we performed these analyses using sas version nine point two sas institute cary nc usa

each of the host institutions table s1 recruited under ethicallyapproved protocols written informed consent was obtained from all subjects
 
the majority of brca2 mutation carriers were recruited through cancer genetics clinics and some came from population or communitybased studies studies contributing dna samples to these research efforts were members of the consortium of investigators of modifiers of brca12 cimba with the exception of one study niccc eligible subjects were women of european descent who carried a pathogenic brca2 mutation had complete phenotype information and were at least eighteen years of age harmonized phenotypic data included year of birth age at cancer diagnosis age at bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy age at interview or last followup brca2 mutation description selfreported ethnicity and breast cancer estrogen receptor status
 
details of these samples have been described previously 2 data from eight hundred and ninetynine young 40 years affected and eight hundred and four older 40 years unaffected carriers of european ancestry from fourteen countries were used to select snps for inclusion on the icogs array
 
fortyseven studies from twentyfour different countries including two eastasian countries provided dna from a total of 10048 brca2 mutations carriers all eligible samples were genotyped using cogs including those from the discovery stage
 
the collaborative oncological geneenvironment study cogs consortium developed a custom genotyping array referred to as the icogs array to provide efficient genotyping of common and rare genetic variants to identify novel loci that are associated with risk of breast ovarian and prostate cancers as well as to finemap known cancer susceptibility loci snps were selected for inclusion on icogs separately by each participating consortium breast cancer association consortium bcac 6 ovarian cancer association consortium ocac 7 prostate cancer association group to investigate cancer associated alterations in the genome practical 8 and cimba snp lists from a brca1 gwas and snps in candidate regions were used together with the brca2 gwas lists to generate a ranked cimba snp list that included snps with the following nominal proportions 555 from the brca1 gwas 416 from the brca2 gwas and fine mapping 29 for cimba candidate snps each consortium was given a share of the array nominally 25 of the snps each for bcac practical and ocac 175 for cimba and 75 for snps from commonly researched pathways eg inflammation for the cimba brca2 gwas we used the icogs array as the platform to genotype the extended replication set of the discovery gwas stage 2 snps were selected on the basis of the strength of their associations with breast cancer risk in the discovery stage 2 using imputed genotype data for one point four m snps identified through ceutsi samples on hapmap3 release two point a ranked list of snps was based on the 1df trend test statistic after excluding highly correlated snps r204 the final list included the 39015 snps with the smallest pvalues an additional set of snps were selected for fine mapping of the regions surrounding the snps found to be associated with breast cancer in the discovery gwas stage rs16917302 on 10q21 and rs311499 on 20q13 including snps with a maf 005 located five hundred kb in both directions of the snp based on hapmap two data the final combined list of snps for the icogs array comprised 220123 snps of these 211155 were successfully manufactured onto the array the present analyses are based on the 19029 snps selected on the basis of brca2 gwas and fine mapping that were included on the icogs array
 
the genotyping was performed on dna samples from 10048 brca2 mutation carriers at the mcgill university and genome quebec innovation centre montreal canada as a quality control measure each plate included dna samples from six individuals who were members of two ceph trios some plates also contained three duplicate pairs of quality control samples genotypes were called using gencall 9 initial calling was based on a cluster file generated using two hundred and seventy samples from hapmap2 to generate the final calls we first selected a subset of 3018 individuals including samples from each of the genotyping centers in the icogs project each of the participating consortia and each major ethnicity only plates with a consistent high call rate in the initial calling were used we also included three hundred and eighty samples of european african and asian ethnicity genotyped as part of the hapmap and one thousand genomes project and one hundred and sixty samples that were known positive controls for rare variants on the array this subset was used to generate a cluster file that was then applied to call the genotypes for the remaining samples
 
of the 211155 snps on the icogs array we excluded snps for the following reasons table s2 on the ychromosome call rate 95 deviations from hardyweinberg equilibrium p107 using a stratified 1df test 10 and monomorphic snps that gave discrepant genotypes among known duplicates were also excluded after quality control filtering 200908 snps were available for analysis table s2 18086 of which were selected on the basis of the discovery brca2 gwas 2 cluster plots of all reported snps were inspected manually for quality figure s1
 
genotypes for snps identified through the one thousand genomes phase i data released jan 2012 11 were imputed using all snps on the icogs chip in a region of five hundred kb around the novel modifier locus at 6p24 the boundaries were determined according to the linkage disequilibrium ld structure in the region based on hapmap data the imputation was carried out using impute two point two 12 snps with imputation informationaccuracy r2030 were excluded in the analyses
 
of 10048 genotyped samples table s2 seven hundred and fortytwo were excluded because they did not meet the phenotypic eligibility criteria or had selfreported nonceu ethnicity samples were then excluded for the following reasons not female xxy xy call rate 95 low or high heterozygosity p106 discordant genotypes from previous cimba genotyping efforts or discordant duplicate samples for duplicates with concordant phenotypic data or in cases of cryptic monozygotic twins only one of the samples was included cryptic duplicates for which phenotypic data indicated different individuals were all excluded samples of noneuropean ancestry were identified using multidimensional scaling after combining the brca2 mutation carrier samples with the hapmap2 ceu chb jpt and yri samples using a set of 37120 uncorrelated snps from the icogs array samples with 19 noneuropean ancestry were excluded figure s2 a total of 4330 affected and 3881 unaffected brca2 mutation carrier women of european ancestry from fortytwo studies remained in the analysis table s1 including 3234 breast cancer cases and 3490 unaffected carriers that were not in the discovery set
 
details of the sample collection genotyping and quality control process for the brca1 and bcac samples are reported elsewhere 13 14
 
the associations between genotype and breast cancer risk were analyzed within a retrospective cohort framework with time to breast cancer diagnosis as the outcome 15 each brca2 carrier was followed until the first event breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis bilateral prophylactic mastectomy or age at last observation only those with a breast cancer diagnosis were considered as cases in the analysis the majority of mutation carriers were recruited through genetic counseling centers where genetic testing is targeted at women diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer and in particular to those diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age therefore these women are more likely to be sampled compared to unaffected mutation carriers or carriers diagnosed with the disease at older ages as a consequence sampling was not random with respect to disease phenotype and standard methods of survival analysis such as cox regression may lead to biased estimates of the associations 16 we therefore conducted the analysis by modelling the retrospective likelihood of the observed genotypes conditional on the disease phenotypes this has been shown to provide unbiased estimates of the associations 15 the implementation of the retrospective likelihoods has been described in detail elsewhere 15 17 the associations between genotype and breast cancer risk were assessed using the 1degree of freedom score test statistic based on the retrospective likelihood 15 in order to account for nonindependence between relatives an adjusted version of the score test was used in which the variance of the score was derived taking into account the correlation between the genotypes 18 pvalues were not adjusted using genomic control because there was little evidence of inflation inflation was assessed using the genomic inflation factor  since this estimate is dependent on sample size we also calculated  adjusted to one thousand affected and one thousand unaffected samples perallele and genotypespecific hazardratios hr and 95 confidence intervals ci were estimated by maximizing the retrospective likelihood calendaryear and cohortspecific breast cancer incidences for brca2 were used 1 all analyses were stratified by country of residence the usa and canada strata were further subdivided by selfreported ashkenazi jewish ancestry the assumption of proportional hazards was assessed by fitting a model that included a genotypebyage interaction term betweencountry heterogeneity was assessed by comparing the results of the main analysis to a model with countryspecific loghrs a possible survival bias due to inclusion of prevalent cases was evaluated by refitting the model after excluding affected carriers that were diagnosed 5 years prior to study recruitment the associations between genotypes and tumor subtypes were evaluated using an extension of the retrospective likelihood approach that models the association with two or more subtypes simultaneously 19 to investigate whether any of the significant snps were associated with ovarian cancer risk for brca2 mutation carriers and whether the inclusion of ovarian cancer patients as unaffected subjects biased our results we also analyzed the data within a competing risks framework and estimated hr simultaneously for breast and ovarian cancer using the methods described elsewhere 15 analyses were carried out in r using the genabel libraries 20 and customwritten software the retrospective likelihood was modeled in the pedigreeanalysis software mendel 21 as described in detail elsewhere 15
 
affymetrix snp six point zero genotype calls for normal nontumor breast dna were downloaded for all available individuals from the cancer genome atlas in september two thousand and eleven point analyses were limited to the four hundred and one individuals of european ancestry based on principal component analysis expression levels in breast tumor tissue were adjusted for the top two principal components age gender there are some male breast cancer cases in tcga and average copy number across the gene in the tumor linear regression was then used to test for association between the snp and the adjusted gene expression level for all genes within one megabase
 
to investigate enrichment of genes associated with breast cancer risk the geneset enrichment approach was implemented using versatile genebased association study 22 based on the ranked pvalues from retrospective likelihood analysis association list go annotator was also used to prioritize gene pathways using functional annotation from gene ontology go 23 to increase the power to detect association to a pathway as opposed to individual genes in the pathway both analyses were corrected for ld between snps variable gene size and interdependence of go categories where applicable based on imputation 100000 monte carlo simulations were performed in vegas and five thousand replicate gene lists using random sampling of snps and five thousand replicate studies sampling with replacement were performed to estimate pvalues
 
we estimated the absolute risks of developing breast cancer based on the joint distribution of snps associated with breast cancer for brca2 mutation carriers the methods have been described elsewhere 24 to construct the snp profiles we considered the single snp from each region with the strongest evidence of association in the present dataset we included all loci that had previously been found to be associated with breast cancer risk through gwas in the general population and demonstrated associations with breast cancer risk for brca2 mutation carriers and loci that had gwas level of significance in the current study we assumed that all loci in the profile were independent ie they interact multiplicatively on brca2 breast cancer risk genotype frequencies were obtained under the assumption of hardyweinberg equilibrium for each snp the effect of each allele was assumed to be consistent with a multiplicative model logadditive we assumed that the average agespecific breast cancer incidences over all associated loci agreed with published breast cancer risk estimates for brca2 mutation carriers 1

we used primary data from the studies in bcac all studies had approval from the relevant ethics committees and all participants gave informed consent a centralized bcac database of information about common risk factors and tumor characteristics was constructed to facilitate studies of potential modifications of snp associations by other risk factors a multistep data harmonization procedure was used to reconcile differences in individual study questionnaires the reference age for cohort studies was calculated at time of enrollment and for casecontrol studies at date of diagnosis for cases and at date of interview for controls all timedependent variables were assessed at reference age this analysis included only subjects of european ancestry that had genotype data for at least three snps and provided information on at least one of the established risk factors relevant data were available from twentyfour studies including sixteen populationbased studies 14 casecontrol and two prospective cohort studies and eight nonpopulationbased studies table 1 table s1 table s2 subsets of data from nineteen studies with eleven populationbased were included in a previous report that assessed interactions between twelve susceptibility variants reproductive history bmi and breast cancer risk 7
 
we included twentyone snps found to be associated with overall breast cancer risk at genomewide statistical significance p5107 10 25 34 and snps for tgfb1 and casp8 from candidate gene studies 17 table s3 for three loci 14q241rad51l1 12p11 casp8 a surrogate snp in high linkage disequilibrium ld r2  one in hapmap ceu was genotyped in a subset table three footnote 19 25 35
 
genotyping was performed in the framework of bcac by taqman and iplex assays and underwent quality control as described previously 10 19 25 34 36 37 genotype data were excluded from analysis on a studybystudy basis according to the following bcac quality control qc guidelines 1 any sample that consistently failed for 20 of the snps within a genotyping round 2 all samples on any one plate that had a call rate 90 for any one snp 3 all genotype data for any snp where overall call rate was 95 4 all genotype data for any snp where duplicate concordance was 98 in addition for any snp where the pvalue for departure from hardyweinberg proportions for controls was 0005 clustering of the intensity plots was reviewed manually and the data excluded if clustering was judged to be poor
 
we used logistic regression to assess the main effects of the snp and environmental risk factors on invasive breast cancer risk analyses were adjusted for study as a categorical variable and reference age as a continuous variable odds ratios or and their 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated for the snp associations assuming a logadditive model and tested for association with a one degree of freedom trend test all statistical tests were twosided
 
the assessment of associations with the environmental risk factors was based on data only from the sixteen populationbased studies to ensure unbiased estimates for comparison with established effect sizes the variables considered were analyzed as continuous age at menarche number of births in parous women age at first birth usual bmi height duration of oral contraceptive use duration of current use of estrogenprogestagen combined therapy duration of current use of estrogenonly therapy packyears of cigarette smoking mean lifetime daily grams of alcohol intake recent physical activity in hours per week or as dichotomous ever parous ever breastfed ever oc use ever smoked current ept use current et use table 2 analyses were performed for all women as well as separately for women aged 54 years and 54 years considering the age groups as surrogates of pre and postmenopausal status differential effects by menopausal status were assessed by adding an interaction term for all categorical variables the lowest level of exposure or no use was used as the reference for evaluating current use of mht by type we used never use of mht as the reference category and additionally adjusted for former use of mht and other mht type as appropriate
 
to test for interactions between snps and environmental risk factors we fitted for each snp two logistic models a model with terms for the snp and the risk factor of interest and another model with additionally an interaction term for the product between the snp number of risk alleles and the risk factor variable we modeled the interaction based on the risk factor variable definitions employed for the main effects all analyses were stratified by study and adjusted for age as a continuous variable the likelihood ratio test was used to compare the difference between the two models and departure from independent multiplicative effects of the snp and the risk factor bmi was the only variable found to show differential effects by menopausal status which is consistent with the literature 38 therefore interaction between snps and bmi was assessed separately for pre and postmenopausal women whereas all other risk factors were evaluated regardless of menopausal status to assess study heterogeneity we calculated odds ratios for interaction for each individual study adjusting for age and reported pvalues for heterogeneity using a qtest subjects with missing data for a particular snp or environmental factor were excluded from the respective analysis we also calculated stratum specific perallele ors for each snp age at menarche 11 1213 14 years number of births 123 4 age at first birth 20 2024 2529 30 years usual bmi 25 2529 30 height 160 160164 165169 170 cm duration of oral contraceptive use and of menopausal hormone use 0 05 510 10 years mean lifetime alcohol intake 0 010 1020 20 gday packyears of smoking 0 110 1020 20 and physical activity 0 035 357 7 hweek
 
for snpenvironment interactions with associated pvalue103 we also compared results after adjusting for additional covariates we performed a total of four hundred and fourteen 23 snps x eighteen risk variables tests to account for chance findings due to multiple comparisons we calculated the false positive report probability fprp for snpenvironment interactions with associated pvalue103 39 the fprp depends on the prior probability that the association between the snp and breast cancer is modified by the environmental risk factor the power of the present study and the observed pvalue since the prior probability of the assessed multiplicative interactions varies depending on subjective evaluation of existing evidence we calculated the fprps for prior probabilities ranging from zero point zero five to 00001 we considered findings with fprp below zero point two to be noteworthy results as previously proposed 39
 
in secondary analyses we examined associations and effect modifications separately for women with erpositive tumors and ernegative tumors each compared to all controls effect heterogeneity by er status was tested using casecase analysis
 
data harmonization was performed using an access database and transformation of the data elements was performed using sas release 92 all other data analyses were conducted using sas release 92 and the r programming language 40

plug preparation of samples and pfge using a chef mapper xa system biorad hercules ca were carried out as in 33 except for the details presented below that are specific for the 2d gels displayed in figure 2 figure 3 figure 6 figure s2b figure s3 and figure s4
 
plugs were prepared using 035 le note not low melting agarose lonza allendale nj and were formed in beckman geneline plug molds having dimensions 252525 mm the 1st dimension chef gels used 075 seakem gold agarose lonza and were made using three mm thick plastic spacers sandwiched between the biorad chef gel tray and a glass plate to give the gels a uniform thickness of only three mm uncut two point five cm long plugs were equilibrated in running buffer 05 tbe before loading the entire plug in the gel wide orientation of gel frame the gels were then run for twentytwo hr using the autoalgorithm mode programmed for two hundred and fifty to one thousand four hundred kb
 
following the 1st dimension run the dnacontaining lanes were two point five cm wide ie the plug width and 13 cm long to obtain material for the 2nd dimension chef two slices 4 mm13 cm each were cut and removed from the center of the 1st dimension lanes leaving about eight mm to either side the remaining flanks of each lane were stained with sybr gold which enabled the bands of interest to be located this procedure avoided the need to stain the lanes prior to the 2nd run since the stain interfered with the migration of chromosome fragments in the 2nd dimension after staining the flanks for ten minutes in sybr gold they were digitally photographed and a ruler was used in the photograph to identify the region of the unstained lane slice corresponding to 220 kb to six hundred kb from just below chr i to just above chr v this section was cut from the fulllength lane slices and processed for the 2nd dimension pfge as follows each lane section was equilibrated in three changes of twentyfive ml sterile te 10 mm tris ph 8 one mm edta treated with sfii new england biolabs ipswich ma four hundred units in four ml total reaction volume including gel slice for five hr at 50c followed by overnight treatment in 1 sarkosyl sigma st louis mo plus one mgml proteinase k invitrogen at 37c and subsequent equilibration with running buffer the map of the positions of the sfii restriction sites relative to the iscei cut site are presented in figure s2a and results for cutting the dna by iscei in vitro prior to 1st dimension and sfii prior to 2nd dimension are presented in figure s2b
 
for the 2nd dimension pfge the treated lane slices were placed near the top of the gel tray long orientation of gel frame to allow for a long run using an end plate from the casting stand on the anode side of the lane slices to stabilize the position of the slices so that they could be attached to the gel tray with two to four ml of agarose on the cathode side of the lane slices after allowing the agarose to cool for five to ten minutes the end block was carefully removed leaving the lane slices attached to the gel tray the gel tray was then mounted in the casting stand and one hundred and eighty ml of 15 le agarose lonza in 05 tbe was carefully poured over the tray containing the attached lane slices this was enough volume to cover the lane slices the 2nd dimension chef was run using the same autoalgorithm as the 1st dimension two hundred and fifty to one thousand four hundred kb except that a longer run time of fortyeight hr was used to compensate for slower electrophoretic mobility in 15 agarose

recombination mapping was performed with eight hundred and sixtytwo variants identified from resequencing thirtyeight stpo cases and thirty stpo controls in a one point two mb region surrounding the initial peak cfa153190000033100000 seven new cases were enrolled subsequent to the initial gwas for a total of thirtyeight stpo cases we evaluated only the thirtyfive cases which shared at least one copy of the riskassociated allele at the peak snp cfa1532383555 for recombination mapping in this analysis a position was identified as the location of a recombination event if a case no longer shared at least one copy of the stpo case major allele ie homozygous for the stpo case minor allele additionally the case needed to continue to be homozygous for the stpo case minor allele for more than one kb we set this requirement in order to take the most conservative approach and to only identify persistent changes in the riskassociated haplotype pattern we note that within the entire one point two mb region only four variants were excluded as recombination events since the change in genotype did not persist for more than one kb for two variants the minor allele only occurred in a subset of dogs with the risk haplotype indicating that these variants are likely mutations that arose on the haplotype after the causal variant the other two variants were only six hundred and eleven bp apart and the stpo case minor allele is the stpo control major allele in this case the association with disease is equally as strong either centromeric or telomeric of these variants as such these two variants most likely resulted from a series of unique crossover events in different generations on the risk haplotype where we cannot unambiguously determine that the causal variant is within the centromeric or telomeric section
 
the additional association analysis compared all thirtyeight stpo cases to thirty unrelated black stpo controls four controls were excluded since they did not have sufficient dna the allelic association was calculated for all eight hundred and sixtytwo variants in a one point two mb region surrounding the initial peak cfa153190000033100000 since none of the variants with minor allele frequencies 10 were significant the data was plotted with the six hundred and fiftyeight variants having minor allele frequencies 10 for clarity figure 3 as with the gwass the allelic association of each variant with the disease phenotype was calculated using plink v106
 
for the haplotype mapping comparing either giant schnauzer n  28 or briard cases n  11 to the stpo cases n  38 we scanned the stpo three recombination interval cfa153208804732901086 for the largest region of haplotype sharing in the previous resequencing effort either the giant schnauzer or briard cases were sequenced with the stpo cases and controls variants from this resequencing were included in the interbreed haplotype analysis along with additional variants which were then genotyped in either breed to make sure that there was a variant on average every one thousand five hundred bp first we started at the centromeric edge of the interval cfa1532088047 and moved variant by variant through the interval we identified variants where all giant schnauzer or briard cases had at least one copy of the stpo case major allele ie where no giant schnauzer or briard cases were homozygous for the stpo case minor allele we then calculated the size of these intervals and the haplotypes within each interval were determined if the haplotype started within the three recombination region we included the area until the end of the haplotype sharing with stpo cases finally the regions of interest were intervals where the giant schnauzer or briard cases share at least one copy of the same haplotype as the majority of stpo cases 50 four snps cfa1532724674 cfa1532749603 cfa1532795285 and cfa1532832982 assumed to have arisen on the haplotype after the mutation or as the result of a series of unique crossover events in separate generations disrupted the haplotype sharing between stpo giant schnauzer andor briard cases and were removed from future analyses

samples were collected from nine sympatric population pairs of mexicana and maize that spanned the known distribution of mexicana in mexico as well as a single allopatric population of mexicana table s1 figure 1 seed samples from twelve maternal individuals per mexicana population n  120 were selected for genotyping a single kernel was also sampled from each of 68 maize ears collected from sympatric maize fields n  69 the tenth kernel down from the tip of each ear was chosen to help control for potential variation in outcrossing rate along the ear seeds were treated with fungicide germinated on filter paper and grown in standard potting mix to the fiveleaf stage freshly harvested leaf tips were stored at 80c overnight and lyophilized for fortyeight hours tissue was then homogenized with a minibeadbeater8 biospec products inc bartlesville ok usa and dna was isolated using a modified ctab protocol 93 purity of dna isolations was determined with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc wilmington de usa samples with 260280 ratios 18 were deemed acceptable for genotyping concentrations of dna isolations were determined with a wallac victor2 fluorescence plate reader perkinelmer life and analytical sciences torrance ca usa using the quantit picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen grand island ny usa single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were generated using the illumina maizesnp50 genotyping beadchip platform and were clustered separately for the two taxa based on the default algorithm of the genomestudio genotyping module v10 illumina inc san diego ca usa clustering for each snp in each taxon was subsequently inspected and manually adjusted of the total of 56110 markers contained on the chip 39029 snps that were polymorphic within the entire sample of maize and mexicana and contained less than 10 missing data in both taxa were used for further analysis
 
observed ho and expected he heterozygosities were summarized for each taxon in each sympatric population pair using the genetics package in r 94 polymorphisms were further characterized as shared fixed or segregating privately within one of each pair of sympatric populations using the sharedpoly program of the libsequence c library 95 pairwise differentiation between populations fst was calculated based on the method of weir and cockerham 96 using custom r scripts and the hierfstat package of r 97 the f3 statistic for identification of admixture 67 was calculated using a custom r script
 
to characterize patterns of introgression across the genome in each population we used two complementary methods 1 identification of ancestry across chromosomal segments with the hidden markov model approach of hapmix 68 and 2 a sitebysite analysis of assignment probabilities using the bayesian linkage model in the program structure 69 70 for both hapmix and structure analyses we used a subset of 38262 snps anchored in a genetic map based on the intermated b73mo17 ibm population of maize 66 jp gerke et al unpublished data the ibm population has been widely used for genetic map development and for determining the genetic architecture of complex traits in maize 98
 
patterns of introgression were assessed using the program hapmix by comparing unphased data from putatively admixed individuals from our sympatric populations to phased data from reference ancestral populations to represent ancestral mexicana haplotypes we chose a population near the town of amatlan morelos state mexico that is currently allopatric to maize an americaswide sample of maize landraces collected largely outside the distribution of mexicana was chosen as the maize reference population 65 in order to assess putative introgression andor false positives in these reference populations we removed each individual and evaluated introgression through comparison to remaining reference samples using a jackknife approach evidence for introgression was assessed in both putatively admixed and reference individuals using hapmix as described below
 
initial estimates of ancestry proportions for hapmix models were based on a previous admixture analysis of mexicana and highland mexican maize 20 introgression of mexicana into maize and 10 introgression of maize into mexicana 36 the number of generations since the time of admixture was varied from 15000 and the maximum likelihood across individuals in a population was used to compare relative time since admixture on a populationbypopulation basis figure s4 subsequent analyses of hapmix output were based on introgression estimates from the highest likelihood run
 
prior to analysis in structure snp data were phased using the program fastphase version 140 99 because structure does not account for linkage disequilibrium ld due to physical linkage snps were grouped into haplotypes separated by at least five kb after grouping our data set consisted of 20035 loci with an average of three point nine two alleles per locus across all sympatric and reference allopatric individuals we ran the linkage model in structure with 5000 steps of admixture burnin a total burnin of 10000 steps and 100000 subsequent steps retained for analysis convergence along the chain and consistency across replicate runs were assessed to ensure an adequate number of steps were included in the analysis assignment was carried out for k  two groups ie maize and mexicana for each chromosome separately probability of assignment was summarized locus by locus across individuals from each population for each taxon
 
to identify snps associated with environmental variables we employed the association method of bayenv 77 using a covariance matrix of allele frequencies estimated with 10000 random snps to control for population structure seventysix climatic and soil variables were summarized as four principal components that captured 95 of the variance among mexicana populations bayenv was run five times with 1000000 iterations for each snp a given snp was considered a candidate if its bayes factor was consistently in the 95th percentile across all five independent runs and its average bayes factor was in the 99th percentile enrichment of significant snps in introgressed regions was determined based on bootstrap resampling for each environmental pc
 
analyses of haplotype sharingidentity by state between mexicana parviglumis and modern maize lines were conducted using the program germline 82 with haplotypes generated by the program fastphase 99 from samples of parviglumis 78 and modern maize 80 shared haplotypes were identified with a seed of identical genotypes at five snps that were extended until mismatch analyses were then based on segments with a minimum size of three cm
 
ten seeds were germinated from each of four maize populations showing little evidence of introgression ixtlan and puruandiro or fixed introgression opopeo and san pedro at two loci one on chromosome four and one on chromosome 9 table s4 putatively linked to highland adaptation 42 78 and showing little evidence of false positives in our reference populations plants were grown under highland conditions with twelve point five hours of light at an intensity of six hundred and eighty molm2s a daytime temperature of 23c and a nighttime temperature of 11c daytime relative humidity was set at 60 and nighttime relative humidity at 80 height measurements were taken at 15 30 and fifty days pigment extent was measured on the second leaf sheath from the top of the plant as the proportion of the total sheath showing pigment macrohairs were also measured on this leaf sheath as the total count one third of the way down from the leaf blade within the field of a dissecting microscope at 2 magnification in order to contrast plant height from our highland treatment to those under conditions more comparable to the lowlands of western mexico we conducted a separate growth chamber experiment with a daytime temperature of 32c and a nighttime temperature of 25c and measured plant height at thirty days all other conditions were identical to those of the highland treatment

sexspecific standard errors and pvalues from each participating study were genomiccontrol gc corrected 74 using the lambda factors as published 25 29 31 then betaestimates were metaanalyzed using the inversevariance weighted fixed effect model as implemented in metal 75 a sensitivity analysis using the samplesize weighted zscore metaanalysis approach yielded the same results only fixed effect model results are shown the 2971914 snps in each of eighteen analyses nine phenotypes in two sexes reduced to 2846694 snps with available chromosome and position annotation in dbsnp the genetic position cm was extracted from hapmap release twentytwo  or  if unavailable  approximated by the inversedistance weighted average of the genetic positions of the nearest hapmap snps release 22 on each side
 
we conducted two types of genomewide searches in the discovery stage a in the sexspecific scan we computed sexspecific association pvalues for each snp concatenated these for all nine phenotypes totaling 50586560 pvalues ie two sexes9 phenotypes285 million snps and selected 20215 snps at 5 fdr 32 pruning this list to independent snps starting with the 20215 snps sorted by increasing pvalue and deleting snps within zero point two cm of any of the snps above yielded six hundred and nineteen independent snps for each snp and for the phenotype that the snp was selected for we also computed pvalues pdiff testing for difference between the metaanalyzed menspecific and womenspecific betaestimates  with corresponding standard errors and using the t statisticthe correlation between and  computed as the spearman rank correlation coefficient across all snps for each phenotype ranged from zero point zero four to zero point one eight across phenotypes from these six hundred and nineteen snps we selected the three hundred and fortyeight snps with nominally significant sexdifference pdiff005 to ensure some level of sexdifference in the discovery whether the sexdifference was significant was then evaluated in the followup stage see below b in the sexdifference scan we computed pdiff for each of the 285 million snps and each of the nine phenotypes and concatenated the totaling 25293280 pvalues we had planned to select snps for followup at an fdr of 5 across all snps and phenotypes but there were none power considerations are provided in the text s1 and figure s4a
 
studyspecific followup data were qualitycontrolled in a similar manner as discovery data with increased attention towards strandissues we conducted sexspecific followup metaanalyses using the same statistical models as for the discovery we combined i in silico studies and ii metabochip studies and then combined results of i and ii implying a double genomic control correction text s1 additionally we conducted a joint metaanalysis combining the sexspecific association results of discovery and followup
 
for snps selected for their small pvalues of sexspecific association the sexdifference estimates and corresponding pvalues in the same data set would be inflated see figure s5 as the two tests are not independent we therefore derived sexdifference estimates and corresponding pvalues in the followup data alone
 
as none of our selected snps stemmed from the scan targeted for oed signals ie the sexdifference scan or showed any evidence of oed in the discovery we targeted our followup analysis for ced or sse signals we filtered for a main effect p for both sexes combined 001 prior to testing for sexdifference pdiff as described above since this increased the power to detect sse and ced signals figure s4b text s1 while this filter did not introduce a bias such as a sexstratified association filter would snps with a pdiff in the followup at 5 fdr were considered as snps with significant sex difference
 
we considered a joint discovery and followup combined association pmen or pwomen5108 as genomewide significant for each phenotype we tested whether there were more malespecific or more femalespecific associations among the associations with established genomewide significance in at least one sex compared to the expected binomial distribution
 
for the identified signals with sexdifference study partners of the discovery and the in silico followup reanalyzed their data stratified by sex and age group 50 years 50 years using the same models as described above age difference was tested within each sex using the same t statistic as applied for the sexdifference testing
 
sexspecific associations of the identified signals with metabolic traits were derived requesting a sexstratified reanalysis from the global lipids genetics consortium glgc triglycerides hdl ldl and total cholesterol 34 the metaanalyses of glucose and insulinrelated traits consortium magic fasting insulin fasting glucose homab homair 35 76 and the diagram consortium type two diabetes 36 we tested the overall number of snps with consistent nominally significant association for the sex that the snp was selected for pwomen or pmen 005 compared to a binomial draw with an event rate of 005 it needs to be noted that this test does not account for the correlation between the traits nor for the fact that the consortia involve an overlap of studies
 
in order to explore whether certain pathways are enriched among the genes depicted by loci with evidence for sexdifference we applied magenta 77 briefly magenta calculates genespecific scores for 18000 genes by combining the pvalues here the sexdifference pvalues from our discovery stage for a specific anthropometric phenotype of snps in and around the genes 40 kb down one hundred kb upstream the genetic score is corrected for potential confounders such as gene size number of independent snps ld pattern length in genetic distance and number of recombination hotspots these scores are ranked and the genes within the top 5 of these scores are tested for enrichment in certain pathways separately for each phenotype as given by different databases go  kegg  ingenuity  and panther  magenta determines whether the genes among the 5 top scores link to certain pathways more often than expected by chance fdr is controlled at 5 via 10000 permutations using a random set of genes with the same number of genes as those observed
 
for the seven confirmed sexdifference loci defined as the regions depicted by snps within one point zero cm of the respective lead snp showing a certain level of association p100  pleadsnp we searched several catalogues and data bases to depict potential biologically relevant links or functional entities we extended the regions of interest to 500 kb around the lead snp if the regions were very small and no gene was inflicted as for the pparg vegfa map3k1 loci
 
first we performed an automated search for reported genes or variants in our regions in pubmed  and omim  using snipper  or manually inspected ucsc pmid 22086951 and ensembl pmid 21045057 genome browsers as well as the nhgri gwas catalog 78 79 second we explored whether snps known to provide reliable tags for copynumbervariations cnvs in europeandescent samples combining four catalogues including sixty thousand one hundred and sixtyseven cnvtagging snps as described previously 31 correlated with our lead snps third we performed several online database searches to establish whether known variants within five hundred kb of each lead snp that are correlated r208 or 05 with our lead snps using snap proxy search 80 might have putative or predicted function i we searched the sift database 81 to determine whether any of these snps was predicted to affect protein function ii we used snpinfo 82 to investigate predicted and putative function in several functional classes including splicing regulation stop codons polyphen predictions snps3d predictions transcription factor binding site tfbs prediction and mirna binding site prediction
 
we examined transcript expression of genes near each of the seven identified snp for human eqtl we explored four different tissues subcutaneous adipose tissue whole blood and lymphoblastoid cells details on methodology and tissue samples in the text s1 we computed sexspecific association including conditional analyses and r2 measures to identify cis eqtl signals that were likely to be coincident with the anthropometric trait signal for mouse eqtl we had four types of tissues inguinal fat gonadal fat liver brown fat with expression derived by realtime rtpcr as well as three types of tissue liver inguinal fat gonadal fat with illumina assays details in text s1 the sexspecific association and a test for sexdifferences were computed

v cholerae and e coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table s1 chrii fragments were amplified from n16961 cvc209 dna by pcr using phusion highfidelity polymerase neb beverly ma the sequences of primers used for pcr are shown in table s2 for cloning sequences up to one hundred bp complementary oligonucleotides idt skokie il were used after annealing the two 29 the exact chrii coordinates of each cloned fragment are given in table s1
 
this was done in l broth cultures of e coli strain br8706 at od600 between 0405 as described 24 to account for any effect that parb2 might have on the replication of the laczreporter plasmid galactosidase activities were normalized for the plasmid copy number in all cases the copy number variation was small one standard deviation was within 20 of the mean the copy numbers were measured see below from aliquots of the same cultures that were used for galactosidase measurements some of the cultures were simultaneously monitored for parb2 amounts by western blotting figure s2 note that  parb2 refer to cells carrying ptvc501 that carries parb2 under iptg control with and without iptg induction respectively in figure two and figure s3 lanes 46  refers to cells carrying ptvc236 which supplies parb2 from a constitutive promoter and  refers to cells carrying the empty vector pacyc184
 
the copy number of laczcarrying plasmids figures 23 s3 s9 were measured exactly as described 32 briefly different experimental cultures were grown to log phase and mixed with separately grown cells carrying pneb193 before plasmid isolation the latter plasmid helped to account for plasmid loss if any during plasmid isolation steps the copy number of oriii plasmids figure 7 was determined similarly except that cells instead of growing in liquid cultures were obtained by washing out colonies from transformation plates directly to avoid mutant accumulation as described 26 the origin fragments were first cloned in a plasmid vector driven by the origin of plasmid r6k and the clones were maintained in cells that supplied the cognate initiator  protein the clones were electroporated into e coli br8706 carrying ptvc499 that supplied rctb but no  protein and ptvc501 that supplied parb2
 
the dna probes were made from plasmids by pcr using oligonucleotides tvc286 5tccgattacggcaccaaatcga3 and tvc287 5 aacgtggataaacttcctgtaat3 which allowed amplification of extra one hundred bp of vector sequences from each flank of the region of interest the pcr products were labeled using thirty units t4 polynucleotide kinase neb and fifty ci of 32atp perkinelmer and purified by passing through g50 columns roche diagnostics binding was done in the presence of three hundred ng poly didc other details are as described 25 except that the binding reactions were run in 05tbe which improved parb2 binding in figure 5 the probe was nonradioactive and was visualized with sybr gold nucleic acid gel stain molecular probes at zero point five mgml for thirty min as nonspecific competitor supercoiled puc19 dna was used instead of poly didc as the former stayed at the top of gels and did not interfere with visualization of probe bands the images were recorded using fuji las3000 imaging system
 
chip assay was performed as described 50 briefly cells of v cholerae cvc209 were cultivated in l broth at 37c to exponential phase and crosslinked with 1 formaldehyde after cell lysis and sonication rctbdna or parb2dna complexes were immunoprecipitated using rctb or parb2 antibody respectively the precipitated dna was amplified labeled and hybridized to a custom agilent eight x 60k v cholerae oligonucleotide microarray representing the whole genome according to the manufacturers protocol and as described 51 the custom tiling array contained sixty bp probes specific for both the crick and watson strands the consecutive probes were separated by one hundred and forty bp in each strand and by ten bp between the watson and crick strands data was extracted using an agilent scanner and agilent feature extraction program individual chip cy5 and input cy3 signals were first normalized with respect to total cy5 and cy3 signals respectively fold change was calculated by dividing the normalized cy5 signals with normalized cy3 signals the values are mean from three independent experiments
 
the effect of roadblock to parb2 spreading was tested by cloning an array of five consensus p1 plasmid iterons in front of chrii origin of ptvc20 resulting in pbjh218 figure 8 consensus iterons were used to avoid the prepa promoter present within the array of natural iterons of p1ori to clone the iterons ptvc20 was modified by creating a ndei restriction enzyme site between pars2b and the 39mer within rcta using quikchange ii xl sitedirected mutagenesis kit agilent technologies and oligonucleotides bjh472 and bjh473 to the resulting plasmid pbjh217 the iteron array amplified from pala753 52 using oligonucleotides bjh475 and bjh476 was cloned at the ndei site resulting in pbjh218 the plasmid pair ptvc20 and pbjh218 was used in the same genetic background as used in figure 7 and additionally in an otherwise isogenic host that supplied p1repa protein from a constitutive promoter blap2 of pbr322 the p1repa gene and the adjoining blap2 promoter was cloned in a d69 vector and the resulting phage dkc311 53 was used to lysogenize br8706
 
the copy numbers of ptvc20 and pbjh218 were nearly identical about fourfold lower than ptvc22 used in figure 7 as was found earlier for ptvc20 29 the copy number was estimated to be about one per cell when there should be four oric the low copy number of ptvc20 and pbjh218 and the lack of an active partitioning system made the plasmids unstable 130130 cells lost the plasmids after seven generations of growth without selection the effect of parb2 was therefore checked only under selection young colonies 1 mm from selection plates were used to inoculate lb medium with appropriate drugs ampicillin at fifty gml chloramphenicol at twentyfive gml and spectinomycin at forty gml and inducers arabinose at 002 and when desired iptg at one hundred m and the cultures were grown to early log phase od60001 and stored in zero point zero one m mgso4 in ice for calculating generation times the cultures were diluted to od600  zero point zero zero two and grown to early log phase generation times were calculated from od600 values in the range 00202 saturation of growth was avoided to prevent accumulation of faster growing revertants relative colony sizes were also determined from the mgso4 suspensions on plates with and without iptg but otherwise identical in volume and contents

the dsb2me96 allele was isolated in a genetic screen for meiotic mutants exhibiting defects in chiasma formation or chromosome organization in diakinesisstage oocytes conducted in collaboration with m hayashi 47 the av334 strain used for this screen which allows visualization of chromosomes using a germlineexpressed gfphistone h2b fusion protein also contains a fusion of chromosomes iv and x parental p0 l4 hermaphrodites were treated with ethyl methanosulfonate ems as in 48 and were plated individually f1 progeny were picked to individual plates to produce progeny and pools of f2 progeny worms from each f1 plate were mounted on multiwell slides in anesthetic 01 tricaine and 001 tetramisole in m9 buffer and their germ lines were visualized for meiotic defects two mutations affecting meiotic recombination me95 and me96 were identified based on the presence of univalents at diakinesis in a the subset of f2s from independent f1s and were recovered by plating of siblings repeated outcrossing with n2 and selecting for the mutant phenotype removed the chromosome fusion as well as the gfph2b transgene mapping complementation testing and sequencing revealed that me95 is an allele of zhp3 containing a ctot transition that results in a premature stop at codon three hundred and fortyeight of the predicted three hundred and eightyseven amino acid coding sequence of k02b128a mapping of the me96 mutation below indicated that it identified a new component of the meiotic machinery
 
initial snp mapping based on the methods of 49 and 50 placed me96 near genetic map position twenty on the right side of chromosome ii to select for informative cos near this region rol1 me96 unc52 worms were crossed with cb4856 males and rol nonunc f2 progeny were selected and genotyped for snp pkp2117 at genetic map position seventeen point nine to select for cos occurring between this marker and unc52 genetic map position 23 informative recombinants were assessed for me96 phenotype and typed using additional snp markers in the region narrowing down the position of me96 to a one hundred and sixtyfive kb interval between snp markers uce22315 and uce22332 comprising thirtysix candidate genes rnai of candidate genes was performed using bacterial clones from the rnai feeding library 51 52 as in 53 worms used were az212 worms which contain gfphistone as this genotype was shown to be more sensitive to rnai 54 rnai against candidate gene f26h116 at 15c but not at 20c phenocopied the me96 mutation eliciting a mixture of bivalents and univalents at diakinesis sequencing identified a ttoa transversion generating an early stop at codon fourteen tta  taa of the predicted f26h116 coding sequence 280 codons total in the me96 mutant
 
a second dsb2 allele me97 was isolated independently in a screen for mutants with altered numbers of gfpcosa1 foci which mark co sites in late pachytene me97 fails to complement me96 and contains a premature stop at codon 168 further confirming the identity of f26h116 as the dsb2 gene except where otherwise noted all analyses were conducted using the me96 allele
 
l4 hermaphrodites were picked to individual plates allowed to lay eggs and transferred to fresh plates every twentyfour hours for three days hermaphrodites start laying eggs after they transition from l4 to adult and lay most eggs in the first three days inviable embryos that do not hatch are indicative of autosomal missegregation while male progeny indicate xchromosome missegregation eggs from eight dsb2me96 rol1e91 hermaphrodites where rol1 is a marker with no meiotic defects were counted the number of eggs counted for each day is five hundred and seventythree day 1 eight hundred and seventynine day 2 and four hundred and eightyeight day 3 with an average of two hundred and fortythree eggs per hermaphrodite over the three day interval
 
numbers of dna bodies present in diakinesis oocytes were assessed in intact adult hermaphrodites of indicated age fixed in ethanol and stained with 46diamidino2phenylindole dapi as in 40 this method underestimates the frequency of achiasmate chromosomes as some univalents lie too close to each other to be resolved unambiguously numbers of nuclei scored were eightyeight and one hundred and six for dsb2 worms one day and two day post l4 respectively fortythree and fiftyseven for wt worms one day and two day post l4 respectively
 
numbers of gfpcosa1 foci in late pachytene nuclei of live anesthetized worms 01 tricaine and 001 tetramisole in m9 buffer  were quantified by taking 3d image stacks on a deltavision microscope gfp foci were counted in the last five rows of pachytene nuclei only nuclei completely contained within the stack were scored and nuclei with features indicative of apoptosis compact and bright mcherryhistoneh2b signal were excluded twentyfour h control data were from fixed immunofluorescence images 13 numbers of nuclei scored dsb2 twentyfour h n  127 dsb2 fortyeight h n  101 wt twentyfour h n  76 wt fortyeight h n  seventyeight point note whereas most nuclei in a mutant that lacks dsbs and cos have zero cosa1 foci 20 have one or two foci presumably reflecting nonspecific aggregation of co proteins when a suitable substrate is absent 13 thus a subset of dsb2 nuclei with one or two cosa1 foci may similarly lack cos especially at fortyeight h post l4 where nuclei with zero foci are frequent
 
immunofluorescence was conducted as in 55 with minor modifications unless otherwise noted all experiments were performed at 4048 hours post l4 worms were cut at the vulva to dissect the gonads in egg buffer with 01 tween20 and fixed with 1 paraformaldehyde in egg buffer for five minutes slides superfost plus were covered with a coverslip and frozen in liquid nitrogen the coverslip was removed and slides were immersed in cold 20c methanol for one minute slides were washed three times for 810 minutes in phosphatebuffered saline containing 01 tween20 pbst and then blocked for one hour with 05 bovine serum albumin bsa diluted in pbst primary antibody solution was added 50 l on top of the dissected gonads and covered with a parafilm square slides were incubated overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature then washed three times for 810 minutes in pbst secondary antibody solution was added 50 l and slides were incubated with parafilm cover for two hours at room temperature in the dark slides were washed three times with pbst and incubated for five minutes with two gml dapi solution in the dark followed by two more washes slides were mounted with vectashield and the coverslip was sealed with nail polish
 
the following primary antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions in pbst with 05 bsa guinea pig antihim8 1500 16 rabbit antihim3 1200 17 guinea pig antisyp1 1200 18 rabbit antirad51 1500 21  guinea pig antisun1 s8p 11000 23 rabbit antidsb2 15000 rat antirad51 1250 guinea pig antidsb1 1500 11
 
an affinitypurified rabbit polyclonal antibody against dsb2 was generated by sdix newark de using the cterminal one hundred amino acids of f26h116 as the immunogen specificity of the antibody was demonstrated both by the lack of chromatin staining in immunofluorescence analysis of dsb2 mutant gonads figure 6a and by western blot analysis figure 6b
 
rat antirad51 antibody was generated using a histagged fusion protein expressed from plasmid pet28a containing the entire rad51s coding sequence 56 immunizations and bleeds were performed by sdix rat anti rad51 was affinity purified against membranebound protein as described in 57 with the following modifications nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in 5 milk in 1tbst and eluates containing rat anti rad51 were further purified by dialysis with 1214 kda dialysis tubing spectrum in 1tbst for one hour and overnight at 4c specificity was demonstrated by showing that rat antirad51 foci colocalize with rabbit antirad51 foci 21 by immunofluorescence and that these recombinationdependent foci are eliminated in spo11me44 gonads
 
all secondary antibodies were alexa fluor goat from invitrogen used at 1200 dilution in pbst with 05 bsa
 
immunofluorescence images were acquired using the deltavision microscopy system applied precision and deconvolved using softworx software images shown are maximumintensity projections of zstacks acquired at zero point three m intervals
 
for each wildtype germ line evaluated rad51 foci were quantified in eight contiguous rows of pachytene nuclei from the region where foci were most abundant the average distance in rows of nuclei between the position of this peak and the end of the transition zone was calculated for wildtype germ lines and this distance was used to define the corresponding regions to be scored in dsb2me96 mutant germ lines in which the abundance of rad51 foci was low throughout quantitation was carried out on deconvolved 3d image stacks using softworx software only nuclei that were completely contained with in the image stack were scored occasional atypical nuclei with condensed bright dapi signals were excluded numbers of nuclei scored wt n  335 dsb2 n  one hundred and ninetysix point
 
for each genotype sixty adult worms 24 hours postl4 were picked into m9005 tween 20 washed gently three times then lysed by resuspension in 2 laemmli sample buffer biorad gel electrophoresis was performed on a 415 criteriot tgx gradient gel biorad followed by transfer of proteins to a pvdf membrane blots were probed with rabbit antidsb2 11000 in 5 milk for two hours followed by hrpconjugated secondary antibody and detection by ecl
 
worms were exposed to one krad 10gy of gammairradiation using a cs137 source the one krad dose was chosen based on its sufficiency to restore chiasmata to 95 of chromosome pairs in affected nuclei of the spo11ok79 mutant 6 worms were irradiated at thirtysix hours post l4 and the number of dna bodies at diakinesis was assessed in worms fixed at eighteen hours postirradiation for both dsb2 and agematched spo11 mutants the dsb2 worms also carried the rol1 marker which does not affect meiosis this assay tends to underestimate the incidence of achiasmate chromosomes as some lie too close together to be resolved numbers of nuclei scored were seventyone and seventysix for dsb2 worms untreated and irradiated respectively seventysix and fortyfive for spo11 worms untreated and irradiated respectively
 
worms were exposed to five krad 50gy of gammairradiation using a cs137 source formation of rad51 foci was assessed by immunofluorescence in gonads dissected and fixed one hour after irradiation germ lines from rad50 and htp1 rad50 mutants were irradiated at twentyfour hours postl4 and stained with dapi rad51 antibody and dsb2 antibody germ lines from dsb2 mutants were irradiated at fortyeight hours postl4 and stained with dapi and rad51 antibody

a total of seven hundred and eightyseven fire ant queens were collected immediately after a nuptial mating flight on may 5th two thousand and ten in a large parking lot target three thousand nine hundred and seventy sw archer rd gainesville fl and weighed since the area of collection has a high prevalence of monogyne colonies we expected these queens to belong to the monogyne social form this was subsequently confirmed by screening one hundred and eight queens for social form using gp9 as a marker following the protocol as described in 90 the remaining six hundred and seventynine queens were split into two groups three hundred and eight queens were set up in pairs pleometrosis based on having similar weights range 02 mg and paintmarked with different colors while three hundred and seventyone queens were set up individually haplometrosis and paintmarked as well all the queens were provided with a nesting chamber consisting of a glass tube halffilled with water which was covered by a cotton ball and a layer of dental plaster this keeps the chamber moist but avoids an excess of water which is deleterious for the young brood tubes were sealed with a loose cap to provide air flow specimens were reared in the dark at 28c 70 relative humidity under claustral conditions no food and no water for one month
 
after eclosion of the first batch of workers minims incipient colonies were provided with water sugar water and frozen crickets glass tubes were set open in pencil boxes coated with fluon to prevent escape queens were subsequently monitored daily until it was possible to identify the social rank of the two cofoundresses in pleometrotic couples previous studies have found that the initial cooperation between the two cofoundresses turns into conflict after the emergence of minims resulting in the execution of one queen 19 queens that survive the competition winners are usually located at the top of the brood pile within the nest chamber and they are generally tended by workers conversely queens that will be executed losers are normally seen outside the nest chamber hiding from workers in order to avoid being attacked figure s4 we used these observations to establish the social rank of the two pleometrotic queens ie winner and loser we collected twentyfive pleometrotic couples and twentyfive haplometrotic queens in dry ice and stored them at 80c to be later processed
 
this assay was performed with thirtyfour couples of pleometrotic queens from the same pool of newly mated queens as experiment one point the queens were paired and placed in nesting chambers as before after emergence of minims queens behavior was monitored as before once the behavioral observation revealed the social rank of the two cofoundresses queens were weighed again and repaired with a different partner we created the following three groups of queens a winnerwinner similar weight b loserloser similar weight and c winnerloser different weights again we monitored the behavior until the social rank of the newly coupled specimens was evident and we collected four new behavioral phenotypes in the same way as above a winners switched into losers winlos n  7 b losers switched into winners loswin n  11 c continuing winners winwin n  12 and d continuing losers loslos n  5
 
individual fire ant queens were thawed and dissected under cold rnalater qiagen valencia ca to confirm the mating status unmated queens were not included in the analysis total rna was extracted using the rneasy plus kit qiagen combined with a rnasefree dnase step qiagen to remove any possible contamination by genomic dna subsequent steps in the microarray analysis were performed at the penn state genomic core facility rna concentration and purity were assessed using nanodrop and qubit and rna quality was assessed using rna nano chips on the agilent bioanalyzer one g of each sample was amplified using the ambion life technologies amino allyl messageamp ii arna amplification kit am1753 fifteen g of arna were dyed with cy3 or cy5 ge health care rpn5661 and subsequently purified according to the ambion kit instructions one point five g of a cy3 labeled sample were combined with one point five g of a cy5 labeled sample and fragmented using rna fragmentation reagents ambion am8740 according to the manufacturers instructions samples were hybridized with mixing in a maui hybridization instrument overnight at 42c arrays were scanned using axon genepix 4000b
 
for the first microarray developed to validate the efficiency of probe sequences we pooled rna samples 2 g total from different castes developmental instars and social forms as follows three female alates fifteen workers five larvae and five pupae from both monogyne and polygyne social forms and five males from monogyne colonies only
 
the fire ant genome includes an official gene set of 16569 proteincoding genes that were generated by a combination of ab initio estbased and sequence similaritybased methods 27 for our microarray studies we combined the official gene set with a set of ests obtained from assemblies of the fire ant transcriptome for a total set of 63436 sequences transcripts we successfully designed 60mer probes for 51531 of these transcripts roche nimblegen inc madison wi these sequencesprobes were grouped into four categories ests with gene models ewgm seven thousand four hundred and thirtythree transcripts ests without gene models ewogm 40613 gene models gm 3246 and gene models redundant with other models gmrwom 239
 
we developed and used a first microarray 1plex 385000 probe capacity roche nimblegen inc madison wi to validate the probe design and test multiple probes per transcript on average we designed seven probes per transcript for a total of 355930 probes each probe was tested for both the red cy5 and the green cy3 dyes for transcripts with only one probe n  296 we verified that the probe had acceptable intensities for both dyes for the other transcripts we examined the performance of the probes with the green dye only because these showed consistently higher intensity compared to the red dye probes were ranked in the follow manner a if there were only two probes per transcript n  230 we selected the one with higher intensity b if there were three to six probes n  744 we calculated the ratio probe intensitymedian intensity of all probes for that transcript and selected the probe with highest ratio if the value was 3 otherwise we selected the probe with the second highest ratio c for transcripts with seven probes n  50261 we followed the procedure as in b but in case the probe with the highest ratio was 3 we removed that probe calculated new ratios and selected a new probe with highest ratio this procedure allowed us to select the probes with highest intensity that were not outliers
 
selected probes were printed in pairs on two 12plex microarrays each array had a 135000 probe capacity roche nimblegen inc madison wi we used a loop design with dye swaps incorporated allowing us to hybridize twentyfour rna samples to each array for experiment one we hybridized eight haplometrotic queens eight pleometrotic winners and eight pleometrotic losers figure s5 and for experiment two we compared six winlos six loswin six winwin and five loslos figure s6
 
any spots with an intensity of less than three hundred the background level on the arrays were removed from the analyses as were spots present on less than twenty out of twentyfour arrays expression data were logtransformed and normalized using mixedmodel normalization proc mixed sas cary nc with the following modelwhere y is expression dye and block are fixed effects and array arraydye and arrayblock are random effects transcripts with significant expression differences between groups were detected by using a mixedmodel anova with the modelwhere y represents the residual from the previous model treatment spot and dye are fixed effects and array is a random effect pvalues were corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate of 0001 for experiment one and 01 for experiment two proc multtest sas because the number of differentially regulated transcripts for experiment one was very high 13000 out of 50000 and to avoid an excess of redundancy among the different groups of transcripts we included only probes corresponding to gm and ewgm see above
 
hierarchical clustering using the ward method and principal component analysis pca for global patterns of gene expression were performed in jmp 902 sas cary nc we used genesis 176 graz austria to cluster differentially regulated genes based on average linkage and to perform kmeans clustering in experiment one point gene ontology analysis was performed using functional annotation chartclustering in david version six 28 29 using david default population background and a cutoff of p005 for all gene ontology go analyses fire ant genes were matched to their drosophila orthologs in flybase  categorizer 31 was used to count the occurrences of significantly enriched go terms within each of the predefined set of parentancestor go terms the array data were deposited on the arrayexpress website according to miame standards arrayexpress accession emexp3886 for experiment 1 emexp3898 for experiment 2
 
we compared the results from experiment one to the following studies
 
experiment two from this study we overlapped five hundred and fortyeight transcripts that were significantly differentially regulated at fdr01 between win and los in experiment one to all the significantly differentially regulated transcripts from experiment two 606 fdr01
 
aging in drosophila we compared directional expressions for all the significantly enriched go terms obtained from functional annotation chart for experiment one and the significantly enriched go terms that were associated to aging in the fruit fly based on zhan et al 47
 
we performed overlaps between list of transcripts and go terms with venny 91 in the first comparative study we overlapped fire ant transcripts directly while in the second study we used drosophila orthologues flybase numbers to compare fire ant transcripts to the genes of the fruit fly statistical significance of the overlap was calculated using a hypergeometric test  selected go analyses based on study overlap were performed in david as above in the second study to test for the significant agreement in the patterns of expression between two studies we performed fishers exact tests in jmp

to determine gene models we first ran tblastn using known hymenopteran vg sequences against ant genome sequences downloaded from the fourmidable database 63 subsequently rubybioruby scripts 64 were used to extract relevant subsets of each genome gene predictions were generated on each subset using maker2 65 s65mand subsequently manually refined using apollo 66 conflicts gene predictions were resolved by using est data when available splice prediction algorithms  and manual verification of splicing consensus sequences
 
inaccurate sequence alignment or phylogeny leads to misleading or incorrect results in molecular evolution analyses we used an approach centered on the use of phylogenetically aware codonlevel aligner prank which is likely to minimize the risks of introducing errors 67 68 this required several steps we preliminarily aligned the twentysix vg protein sequences with mafft linsi 69 and removed ambiguous sections of the alignment using trimal option gappyout 70 a first tree was built with raxml model gtrgammai 71 and rooted with nwroot newick utilities package 72 this tree was used as a guide tree in prank 73 to obtain a highquality codonlevel alignment of the twentysix vg coding sequences ambiguous sections of the alignment were removed using trimal option gappyout and a final tree was built with raxml gtrgammai model 10000 bootstraps were generated to assess its confidence selective pressures dnds on different parts of the phylogenetic tree were estimated using the branchsite codonsubstitution model from codeml paml 46 74 such dnds ratios are obtained by computing the number of nonsynonymous changes dn over synonymous changes ds see table two for more details vg site coordinates s44 e382 n456 are given as in apis mellifera vg uniprot identifier vitapime

pogonomyrmex barbatus founding queens were collected during nuptial flights on july 15th two thousand and eight in bowie arizona usa n321854w1092903 colonies were then kept in laboratory conditions 30c 60 humidity and twelve h12 h lightdark cycle in 15135 cm plastic boxes with water tubes and were fed once a week with grass seeds and a mixture of eggs honey and smashed mealworms thirty months later five of these colonies were used to collect samples on december 16th two thousand and ten point task performance in workers is age related thus nurses tend to be younger than foragers 2 young ants interacting with the brood in the nest tube were considered as nurses to collect foragers each colony was connected with a cardboardmade bridge to a foraging area composed of a plastic box containing grass seeds any ant handling a food item in the foraging area was considered as forager ant samples were flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80c for further rna extraction
 
whole body worker samples were used to measure the expression of pbvg1 and pbvg2 genes rna extractions were performed using a modified protocol including the use of trizol invitrogen for the initial homogenization step rneasy extraction kit and dnase i qiagen treatment to remove genomic dna traces for each individual worker cdnas were synthesized using five hundred ng of total rna random hexamers and applied biosystems reagents levels of mrna were quantified by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction qrtpcr using abi prism seven thousand nine hundred sequence detector and sybr green all qpcr assays were performed in triplicates and subject to the heatdissociation protocol following the final cycle of the qpcr in order to check for amplification specificity qrtpcr values of each gene were normalized by using an internal control gene rp49 paralogspecific primers table s1 were designed using sequence alignment 75 and primer analysis 76 programs primer sequences overlapped coding regions split by introns allowing the specific amplification of cdna levels over eventual genomic dna contaminations transcript quantification calculations were performed by using the ct method 77
 
all data were analyzed using r  and the r packages lme4 78 and language r 79 the effect of caste on gene expression relative values was analyzed using linear mixed effects models to avoid pseudoreplication the colony was included as a random effect we checked for normality and homogeneity by visual inspections of plots of residuals against fitted values to assess the validity of the mixed effects analyses we performed likelihood ratio tests to confirm that the models with fixed effects differed significantly from the null models with only the random effects throughout the paper we present mcmc markovchain monte carlo estimated pvalues that are considered significant below the zero point zero five threshold all significant results remained significant after bonferroni correction

we analyzed waistbased traits including waist circumference wc and waisthip ratio whr a measure of body fat distribution 43 details regarding trait acquisition within each cohort can be found in the text s1 individuals less than twenty years of age were excluded from all analyses within each cohort we created two sets of residuals for wc and whr one adjusted for age age2 study site if applicable and another additionally adjusted for bmi analyses were conducted separately for men and women the raw residuals were then transformed through an inverse normal function for each subgroup and these transformed residuals were used as our phenotypes in the association analyses the cohorts with related individuals additionally performed sexcombined analysis we analyzed four phenotypes waist circumference wc waist circumference adjusted for bmi wcbmi waist hip ratio whr and waist hip ratio adjusted for bmi whrbmi
 
we conducted analysis of wc and whr in up to thirtythree thousand seven hundred and thirtyeight and twentyseven thousand four hundred and eightynine aa individuals respectively specifically the analysis included for wc up to 23564 individuals and whr up to 19744 individuals in stage one while 10174 aa individuals with wc and 7745 aa individuals with whr in stage two point stage one cohorts were part of the care consortium and other cohorts that were identified with gwas data at the time the study started stage two cohorts with in silico gwas data were identified later some participating studies including cfs family heart study genoa hufs hypergen genestar jhs mesafamily and signet regards sugar are family studies the care consortium aric cardia cfs jhs mesa consists of several populationbased studies that included african ancestry individuals the whi study was a clinical trial handls is a communitybased study family heart study is a multicenter familybased study genestar is a prospective study of vascular diseases genoa and hypergen are cohorts of sibships enriched for hypertension health abc is a random sample of medicare beneficiaries in and surrounding pittsburgh pennsylvania and memphis tennessee hufs is a populationbased family study in the washington dc metropolitan area mec is a prospective cohort study including a nested breast cancer casecontrol study wchs is a casecontrol study of breast cancer in the new york city and new jersey cbcs is populationbased casecontrol study on breast cancer both mec and mda are prostate cancer casecontrol studies black womens health study is an ongoing followup study of 59000 african american women from across the us chs is a populationbased study of risk factors for chd and stroke regards is an observational cohort and sugar is a community based family studies focusing on type two diabetes each participating study has obtained institutional review board approval on research involving human subjects and all subjects provided written informed consent details regarding each cohort can be found in the text s1
 
genotype information for each cohort is presented in supplementary table s2 as shown in table one  the genetic ancestry of our samples african american is also partly from european ancestry simply using all yri sample as reference panel would be inappropriate given that we generally see an average of 20 ceu admixture to better capture the genetic structure of our samples all the genotypes from discovery cohorts were imputed using combined hapmap 11 ceuyri as reference panel this imputation has resulted in an allelic concordance rate of 956 which is compatible to rates calculated with the hapmap two yri individuals 44 our followup stage stage 2 included in silico and de novo followup cohorts insilico followup studies similarly use the combined ceuyri in hapmap as their reference panel for genotype imputation then the expected allele dosage was used in the association analysis to account for the uncertainty introduced by the genotype imputation more details regarding imputation were in supplementary table s2
 
in each discovery study genomewide tests for association between snps and phenotypes were conducted separately for men and women using linear regression with principal components adjustment to adjust for global population substructure in studies from families men and women were also combined for analyses linear mixed effect models where appropriate were used to account for the relatedness in family studies
 
in addition to studyspecific filters a centralized quality control procedure was performed to extensively examine and check all studyspecific results files before metaanalysis we examined the plausible values for all reported summary statistics to check for potential errors the genomic control lambda  value for each set of results was checked for potential pvalue inflation we analyzed snps with imputation quality scores greater than zero point three for studies using mach or bimbam software and greater than zero point four for studies that used other imputation software such as impute additionally we filtered out snps where the minor allele frequency times the number of subjects was smaller than or equal to 5 to ensure robust estimates
 
we performed fixedeffects metaanalyses of studyspecific genomewide association results using the inversevariance weighted approach for the traits described above three sets of metaanalyses were conducted for each phenotype using 1 men only results 2 women only results and 3 joint menonly and womenonly results for studies of unrelated individuals and sexcombined results for studies with related individuals the calculated  genomic control gc correction was applied to each cohorts result recent studies showed that under polygenic inheritance test statistics in large metaanalyses are expected to be elevated even when there is no population substructure 22 23 to avoid an overly conservative adjustment we focused on the single gccorrected result however we also report the double gccorrected pvalue for the joint metaanalysis of the stage one and stage two samples
 
as a sensitivity analysis we assessed the impact of local ancestry by including snp specific local ancestry estimates as a covariate in models for genomewide significant signals in both the care and whi studies locusspecific ancestry ie probabilities of whether an individual has 0 1 or two alleles of african ancestry at each locus was only available for directly genotyped snps and was estimated using a hidden markov model and the local haplotype structure to detect transitions in ancestry along the genome 45 we considered signals robust to adjustment for local ancestry when the beta was numerically similar
 
we applied a procedure to evaluate the transferability of association signals across different ethnicities 46 specifically in addition to validating the previously reported index snps identified in studies of ea participants 17 we interrogated the surrounding genomic regions in our aa samples for each reported index ea snp we first examined the results in our aa samples and tested for consistency of direction with respect to the beta coefficients of index snps between ea and aa samples to accommodate the difference of ld structure across ethnicities we then interrogated 250 kb regions around the index snps and identified the snp with the smallest pvalue in aa within the interrogated genomic region the locispecific significance threshold was based on bonferroni correction defined as zero point zero five divided by the number of independent snps within an interrogated region snps meeting genomewide p50108 or suggestive 50108p50106 in the stage one metaanalysis were carried forward for followup in stage two and joint stage one and two metaanalysis to test the consistency of effect directions between aa and ea samples a pvalue was calculated based on the cumulative binomial distribution for the observed or more extreme number of variants with a consistent direction
 
an analysis approach consistent with the discovery stage ie stage 1 described above was used for the stage two studies in this stage the variants of interest identified from our analysis of stage one and interrogation of previously published ea whrbmi loci were followed up in different samples for followup metaanalysis and confirming the association we then conducted additional joint metaanalysis including studies from both stage one and stage two discovery and followup data in stage two analysis the replication was defined as having a beta coefficient consistent with the discovery stage followup pvalues are thus represented as onesided tests for the joint analysis we used the standard threshold of pvalue5108 for genomewide significance and a locusspecific bonferroni corrected threshold for the regions identified by the giant consortium
 
for newly identified snps from both genomewide association analyses and previous region interrogation analyses we performed sexspecific association analyses and also tested the difference of metaanalyzed sexspecific betaestimates  and  using the tstatisticwhere r is the spearman rank correlation coefficient between and across all snps note that we are comparing two parameters and testing whether their difference is equal to zero this is basically the setting of a twosample test although based on our sample size n5000 in combined analysis the zstatistic should work well due to the central limit theory however we intended to conservatively use the tstatistic here to calculate the pvalue
 
we also examined the giant consortium results 17 for evidence of association for the novel loci identified in the aa samples we applied similar interrogation procedures detailed in the previous section of the interrogation of giant loci in the samples of african ancestry briefly we first looked up the association results for the aa index snp in giant and followed up with the interrogation of its 250 kb flanking region the significance was evaluated as zero point zero five divided by the number of independent variants within the interrogated region
 
for the newly identified snps from both gwas and the interrogation analysis we performed crosstrait association analyses of metabolic risk factor and related anthropometric measures including bmi 26  hdlcholesterol 24 ldlcholesterol 24 triglycerides 24 glucose and insulin 25 and height christopher haiman personal communication in aa samples for the newly identified snps from both genomewide association analysis and the interrogation analysis

all scerevisiae strains used in this study see table s1 for genotypes are derived from 1bd770 69 the mutant ura34 allele in this strain was reverted to wild type by transformation with wild type ura3 dna obtained by pcr yielding the lan201 strain lan211 is an autodiploid of lan201 obtained by ho endonuclease expression followed by selection for diploids the haploid ung1deficient strain lan200 was described previously 62 autodiploidization of lan200 resulted in the diploid ung1 strain lan210
 
standard yeast media were used 70 for selection of mutants we have used synthetic complete sc agar plates without arginine with sixty mgl of lcanavanine or 01 of foa for induction of deaminase expression minimal synthetic media with addition of 1 raffinose and 2 galactose was used
 
mutation frequencies were determined by fluctuation analysis as described previously 69 for the hap experiment independent lan201 or lan211 clones were grown in rich ypd media overnight hap was added to the media where applicable to a final concentration fifty gml after overnight incubation at 30c cultures were plated undiluted on synthetic complete media with canavanine sccan to select for can1 mutants and with dilution to complete sc plates to estimate viability the can1 gene encodes arginine permease which transports the toxic arginine analog canavanine into cells inactivation of can1 renders cells resistant to canavanine
 
for the pmcda1 experiments plasmid pescleupmcda1 was constructed as follows total rna was extracted from the blood of sea lamprey petromyzon marinus and reversetranscribed with oligo dt pmcda1 was amplified with primers noticda1nf 5tttgcggccgcaccatgaccgacgctgagtac location 118135 in genbank accession ef094822 and speicda1cr 5 tttactagtgcaacagcaggactcttagtg location 724742 in ef094822 and cloned into pescleu vector stratagene for yeast experiments lan200 or lan210 strains were transformed with the pescleupmcda1 expression plasmid or with the vector only 31 37 colonypurified transformants were inoculated in five ml of synthetic liquid media without leucine containing 1 raffinose after overnight incubation galactose was added to cultures at a final concentration of 2 galactose activates the gal110 promoter in the pescleu vector which induces the expression of deaminase after one day of incubation culture suspensions were plated undiluted on sccan and with dilution on complete plates
 
lan201 and lan211 were streaked on ypdau plates and grown overnight the next day they were replicaplated on fresh ypd plates and a drop of hap was added to sterile filter paper placed on the agar surface so that different yeast patches receive a similar hap dose the next day streaks were replicaplated on sccan plates to select for mutants one canr colony was picked from one streak then colonypurified and frozen as a glycerol stock at 80c to obtain nonmutant haptreated clones yeast from ypd plates with hap the same plates used to obtain canr clones were streaked on ypdau plates without hap and then colonypurified all of the isolated haptreated nonmutant clones were confirmed to be cans
 
in the pmcda1 experiments lan200 and lan210 were transformed with pescleupmcda1 individual transformants were then inoculated in five ml of liquid synthetic media containing glucose and without leucine followed by incubation for one day at 30c with shaking cells were then pelleted washed once with sterile water then resuspended in twelve ml of synthetic media without leucine containing 2 galactose and 1 raffinose followed by incubation for three days at 30c with shaking aliquots of the resulting yeast suspensions were plated on synthetic complete media containing canavanine to select for can1 mutants aliquots of diluted cultures were plated on synthetic complete sc plates to estimate viability individual canr colonies one per each independent culture were colonypurified and stored at 80c pmcda1treated nonmutant clones were arbitrarily picked up from sc plates these clones were confirmed to be cans

isolated yeast genomic dna was used to construct fragment libraries using the recommended kits for sequencing on the unmc ngs core laboratorys hiseq two thousand instrument we multiplexed individual yeast libraries each derived from an individual clone in a single lane of an illumina flow cell each of the yeast genomes was sequenced at 100 to 300 coverage depending on the run by sequencing one hundred and one bp from each end of the individual dna fragments in the library 101 bp pairedend sequencing according to illuminas recommendations during the instrument run and after sequencing of the yeast libraries was completed a variety of quality assurance qa measurements were made to ensure the integrity of the dna sequence data the dna bar codes used for multiplexing were first used to partition the reads into their respective samplespecific bins and then the bar codes were stripped from the reads to yield samplespecific dna sequences of interest basecalling error correction was performed on each samplespecific set of demultiplexed raw reads using quake 72 raw illumina resequencing data for the lan211 strain and for the various mutant and nonmutant clones were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive wwwncbinlmnihgovsra accession numbers sra057025 and srp014741
 
about ten million pairend reads generated by sequencing of the wholegenome library obtained from the lan201 reference strain were used for de novo genome assembly using clc bios genomics workbench software clc bio aarhus denmark this resulted in four hundred and fiftyeight contigs of various lengths from two hundred to 217386 bp these contigs were aligned to the genome of the standard yeast strain s288c using batch blast after sorting of the contigs by chromosome each set was scaffolded ordered and oriented against the corresponding chromosome using geneious pro software biomatters ltd auckland new zealand 73 consensus sequences were extracted from the scaffolds and used in the next step of reference genome assembly raw sequencing data the same ten million reads that were used for the de novo assembly were then assembled to the extracted consensus sequences and snvs were detected using geneious pro after manual identification of false positives and the correction of alignments a new consensus was obtained this version 1 lan201 draft genome assembly covers 9274 of the standard s288c yeast genome downloaded from the saccharomyces genome database sgd wwwyeastgenomeorg in october two thousand and eleven point this draft assembly has a gc content of 3824 compared with 3831 for s288c see table s2 lan211 is identical to lan201 except for the mating type locus to obtain references of ung1deficient strains lan200 and lan210 sequencing reads corresponding to lan210 were assembled on the lan211 draft in geneious pro snvs were called manually checked and then a consensus sequence was deduced this resulted in a lan210 draft genome assembly the reassembly of the lan200 reads on the lan210 reference followed by snv calling confirmed that the two strains are isogenic these draft genome assemblies were used to analyze the genomes of mutant clones ung1 and ung1 reference genomes are compared in table s2
 
ten to twenty million pairend reads per clone were comparatively assembled on the lan211 for hap or lan210 for pmcda1 reference genomes using geneious pro snvs were called using homozygous snv frequency 80 and heterozygous 40  snv frequency 80 modes the threshold snv call frequencies 40 and 80 were selected based on pilot experiments designed to optimize the detection of true snvs and reduce the number of false positives regions of high and low coverage more than two standard deviations from the mean were excluded from the analysis at this point a fraction of nonexpected substitution types was observed in the genomes these included nongcat and nonatgc mutations in haptreated genomes and nongc to at mutations in pmcda1treated genomes the majority of these snvs were found in the regions where reads were clearly misaligned to the reference ie having low mapping quality the rest of the nonexpected snvs were found in the otherwise good regions of assembly we pcramplified some of the representative genomic regions where expected and nonexpected snv types were detected and then sequenced these amplicons using the sanger method all snvs of the expected types were indeed present in the genomes whereas all nonexpected snvs were found to be assembly errors for example we observed frequent putative ac transversions in acc or acccc sequence motifs but these were not confirmed by sanger sequencing based on these results we removed all nonstandard snvs from the data set finally detected snvs were extracted from the alignments for further analyses table s6
 
the predicted effects of snvs on proteins were analyzed in geneious pro 73 to extract the genomic sequence context of mutations we used ad hoc program rseq1 consensus sequences also called sequence logos fig 3 were created using weblogo three  74 with adjustment for the gc composition of the corresponding genomes and reporter genes
 
the mannwhitney test as used to compare differences in mutation loads in different types of mutant and nonmutant clones see fig 4 this result suggests that the difference between haploid and diploid strains is significant reflecting differences in their ability to tolerate the high frequency of induced mutations

we queried the amigo one point eight gene ontology database for each gene located within 250 kb of the seven replicated snps including rs1801725 casr  last accessed november 6 2012 we used homo sapiens as a filter for species
 
for each of the seven replicated snps we identified all proxy snps with r208 in hapmap ceu releases 21 22 and hapmap three vers 2 using the online snap database  we then queried each of these forty snps in the eqtl database of the university of chicago 
 
the rs1801725 snp encodes a missense variant in exon seven of the casr gene leading to an alanine to serine substitution a986s given the key physiological role of casr in calcium homeostasis monogenic disorders of calcium balance this gene was the logical candidate for analysis in mouse at this previously identified locus
 
for the six newly identified loci the precise rationale for gene selection varied from one locus to the other but the main criteria was to focus on the most biologically relevant gene rs1550532 on chromosome two is an intronic snp of dgkd which was the most likely biological candidate for this locus and was therefore selected for analysis in mouse none of the other genes located in this region 250 kb has a known link with calcium homeostasis  box one  and rs1550532 is not in strong linkage disequilibrium with an eqtl table s6 we also took into account the fact that another member of the dgk family namely dgkh was located near one of the other replicated loci on chromosome thirteen point
 
rs780094 on chromosome 2 is located in intro sixteen of gckr and is in strong linkage disequilibrium r2  093 in caucasians 20 with a common nonsynonymous snp p446l rs1260326 associated with glucokinase activity in vitro 20 21 this snp has been associated with multiple other phenotypes in previous gwas and it is in strong linkage disequilibrium with an eqtl table s6 previous fine mapping analysis of this locus has attributed the signal from rs780094 to the functional rs1260326 variant 20 the gckr locus may indirectly influence calcium concentrations via its association with albumin levels 22 in line with this we observed an attenuation of the association of rs780094 with albumincorrected serum calcium compared to the association with uncorrected serum calcium and we found gckr not to be expressed in any of the key organs involved in calcium homeostasis that we tested in mice we selected gckr for analysis in mouse at this locus
 
rs10491003 on chromosome ten is located within a long noncoding rna for this locus we selected gata3 the nearest and only gene located within this region for analysis in mouse gata3 is implicated in monogenic disorders of calcium balance
 
rs7481584 is located within cars intronic snp in an imprinted region known to play a role in multiple cancers which makes this locus a plausible candidate for malignancyrelated hypercalcemia other plausible biological candidates in this locus are nap1l4 phlda2 and ckdn1c  box one  rs7481584 is in strong ld with two eqtls one associated with the expression of nap1l4 rs2583435 and the other one associated with the expressions of slc22a18 and slc22a18as we selected cars nap1l4 phlda2 and ckdn1c for analyses in mouse
 
for rs7336933 we selected the two only genes dgkh and kiaa0564 located under this association peak on chromosome thirteen for analyses in mouse
 
finally rs1570669 is an intronic snp of cyp24a1 a strong biological candidate implicated in monogenic disorders of calcium balance the two other genes of this region bcas1 and pfdn4 have no known link with calcium homeostasis furthermore rs1570669 and pfdn4 are separated by a recombination hot spot we selected cyp24a1 for analysis in mouse
 
as animal experiments started while the replication process was underway we had also initially selected the following genes for analysis in mouse rsg14 and slc34a1 at locus rs4074995 discovery p value  24e07 vkorc1l1 at locus rs17711722 discovery p value  28e11 pygb at locus rs2281558 discovery p value  64e07 cd109 at locus rs9447004 discovery p value  81e06 no gene was selected for the rs2885836 and rs11967485 and rs12150338 loci in the absence of obvious candidate results for these unreplicated loci can be found in figures s6 s7 and s8 we present these results for quality control purposes slc34a1 also known as napi3 or npt2 which encodes solute carrier family thirtyfour sodium phosphate member 1 was expressed in the kidney but neither in duodenum nor in bone as expected based on current knowledge on this phosphate transporter in the kidney slc34a1 was mainly expressed proximally and slc34a1 expression was upregulated under low calcium diet which is in line with the known function of this gene
 
five c57bl6 mice janvier per group were fed for one week three different diets in which the percentage of calcium were 017 low calcium diet 082 normal calcium diet and 169 high calcium diet and had free access to water 1212 hours lightdark alternance was imposed at the end of the week of the specific diet spot urine were collected and mice were anesthetized blood was collected by retroorbital puncture organs were immediately harvested and snap frozen rna was extracted using trizol invitrogen and reversed transcribed with primescripttm rt reagent kit takara bio inc calcium sodium phosphate and creatinine in plasma and urine were analyzed at the central lab of the lausanne university hospital using a cobasmira analyzer roche

we collected the publicly available data from cancer genome studies reported in pubmed from two thousand and seven through december two thousand and eleven 115 together with the five largest datasets available from the international cancer genome consortium icgc the cancer genome datasets varied widely in terms of sequencing strategies mapping techniques and variantcalling algorithms implying that the power to detect sbss may differ depending upon the datasets and methodologies used 85 however all studies excluded base variants present in matchedcontrol tissues such that the reported sbss were changes attributed to somatic mutations in the tumor tissue matched controls were used for all patient samples on average between six 15 and one thousand eight hundred and thirtyfour 1 tumorspecific sbss were reported in the ews studies between one thousand and twelve 3 and 50000 8 in the gws studies table 1 which is 13 orders of magnitude lower than the numbers of nonsynonymous and splicesite variants noted on average in wholeexome studies 86 in addition to normaltumor matched samples single nucleotide polymorphisms present in dbsnp databases or in the venter and watson genomes 1 10 11 were also used to exclude common base variants differences in variantcalling power were mitigated in our study since we examined relative proportions of mutated sequences rather than absolute mutation fractions
 
a second source of variation in detecting sbss among the cancer genome studies was the sequencing instrument used illumina sequencers have been reported to yield systematic basecall errors especially at the last base of contextspecific ggc and ggt sequences which affect either the forward or reverse strand and at inverted repeats 87 88 the sequencing technologies employed included illumina genome analyzers solid nextgeneration dna sequencing ion semiconductor sequencing dubbed cpal combinatorial probeanchor ligation nanoballs capillary electrophoresis four hundred and fiftyfour pyrosequencing and mass spectrometry often used in combination to verify variant calling illumina sequencers were the most commonly instruments employed in the studies whose data we used 1 3 4 6 7 1014 the frequency of such basecall errors has been estimated at 0103 before filtering and even lower after filtering samtools 87 considering that sequencing errors tend to occur over long simple repeat tracts which have low mappability and that systematic errors at ggt were ignored we analyzed mutations at gc bps only it seems unlikely that basecall errors have biased our analyses by 01 an acceptable limit
 
approximately half of the human genome sequence comprises highly homologous repetitive dna elements alu repeats line elements etc and simple repeats and an additional 36 contains segmental duplications ie segments of 1 kb in length that are present at multiple loci and which share 9098 sequence similarity  thus because only the mappable genome may be scored for mutations we used various methods to estimate the total number of mappable ngnn sequences to use as denominators in the f i fractions see below three methods were used for the gws studies 1 the entries with a mappability index of one representing unique sequences from file wgencodedukemapabilityuniqueness35bpbigwig  generated for the encode project by the duke university institute for genome sciences and policy igsp and at the european bioinformatics institute ebi which we refer to as duke35 2 we selected sequences from the mappability file wgencodecrgmapabilityalign50merbw  89 donohue et al unpublished data referred to as crg50 and 3 we retrieved all ngnn sequences in the grch37hg19 release of the human genome assembly chromfatargz file at  thg19
 
for the ews studies the sureselect human all exon kit  was the most common platform reported 2 4 7 13 a custom refseq ccds pcr primer library was used to generate the glioblastoma dataset 5 and a set of 1507 genes oncogenes tumor suppressors druggable targets were targeted in the mixed cancer dataset 15 hence three methods were used to estimate the number of mappable ngnn sequences in the ews studies ie the ngnn counts from 1 the file s0293689coveredbed  listing the coordinates of exons targeted by the sureselect human all exon kit agilentv2 2 the refseq exons sequences of cgr50 crg50exon and 3 the total refseq exons from file seqgenemd at ftpftpncbinihgovgenomeshsapiensmapviewseqgenemdgz texons
 
we defined fi  miti where mi was the number of mutations at a specific ngnnnncn sequence henceforth designated as ngnn and ti was the total number of that sequence in one of the six mappable sets described above the total number of ngnn sequences was doubled for the selfcomplementary agct cgcg ggcc and tgca sequences since like all ngcn sequences they contain two mutations sites one on the forward and one on the reverse strand in relation to the counts of mutated ngnn motifs if the g occurred at the same genomic coordinate more than once within a cancer dataset or if it was a homozygous mutation it was considered as one count custom shell and fortran scripts were used to obtain the total numbers of mappable ngnn and f i fractions see text s1 for sample scripts the normalized fractions of mutated dgnn sequences were defined as fi  fifi thus fi scaled to one point n indicates any base acgt d indicates agt b indicates cgt as mentioned sequence designation implies doublestranded dna ie agtc  5agtc35gact3 the average base stacking free energies g were obtained from friedman and honig 51 by using the g i  2 values for the three base steps dpg  gpn  npn3 the free energy of base stacking g is an estimate of the absolute contribution of base stacking to nucleic acid stability in the absence of hydrogen bonding interactions and contains a contribution from nonpolar plus electrostatic forces as assessed from a theoretical approach using the amber force field and a continuum solvation model of water the largest contribution to g was found to arise from nonpolar 51 as opposed to electrostatic interactions nonpolar interactions were contributed for the most part by enhancement in the lennardjones component as a result of close packing and to a smaller extent from hydrophobic interactions thus the g values follow the same trend as the nonpolar contributions to free energies of base stacking gnp ie purinepurine  purinepyrimidine  pyrimidinepurine  pyrimidinepyrimidine in qualitative agreement with experimental determinations 51 the relative enrichment e of sequence i ei was defined as the ratio diti where di  didi di being the number of times sequence i was mutated at least twice at the same hg19 coordinate and ti  titi ti being the total number of occurrences of sequence i exomewide texons finally s  snsn and sn  tncn tn being the number of times the combined top sequences were recurrently mutated and cn being the total number of ns substitutions in a particular type of cancer
 
threedimensional structures of the twelve possible doublestranded dgn trinucleotides were constructed using w3dna 90 hydrogen atoms atomic charges and four neutralizing na counterions were assigned to each sequence according to the amber99 force field 91 using ucsf chimera 92 na counterions were positioned next to the four dna backbone phosphates each trinucleotide was energy minimized in vacuo using the 10000 steps steepest descent algorithm and the amber99 force field in gromacs 451 93 ten and fourteen a cutoffs were used for coulomb and van der waals interactions respectively
 
vips were computed using kohnsham density functional theory dft 94 employing the minnesota m062 functional 95 96 with allelectron 631gd basis sets 97 98 as implemented in the gamess electronic structure package 99 and including backbone phosphate groups and sodium counter ions in addition to the dgn doublestranded bases the m062 functional was used since this method provides accurate descriptions of hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between basepairs we reasoned that the dgn set would provide the same type of information as the computationally more demanding ndgn set molecular orbitals were depicted using the macmolplt graphics program 100
 
for individual patient samples mutations were collated and sorted into lists of genes carrying mutations using customized r scripts  the gene lists for each sample were entered into our pattern extraction pipeline analysis ppep 101 as implemented in the wps package 102 to obtain the listhit of genes number of genes from each list that are annotated to each pathway for each of the biocarta pathways for each tumor type each pathway was ranked on the basis of how frequently it was hit by individual patient samples and the ranking scores were obtained as the percentages of patient samples that had at least one hit in the corresponding pathway using customized r scripts the tumor type ranking scores for each pathway were combined and used to rank the pathways for all tumor types the highest ranked pathways represent the most popularly hit pathways amongst all types of tumors for each highly ranked pathway the genes carrying the mutations were retrieved from each patient sample ranked and displayed as genelevel heatmaps for the pathway analysis of recurrent ns substitutions the relevant genes for each tumor type were collated into lists and subjected to ppep analysis as described above
 
agglomerative hierarchical clustering dendrograms 103 were built using either the regression coefficients r between the fractions of mutated dgn sequences fdgn and the vip values or the absolute orthogonal distances manhattan distances between each fngnn data point for all datasets alltoall comparisons were performed allowing the relative estimation of all components of the systems including the reference vip branch

the datasets used in this study are described in depth elsewhere 30 31 briefly dna from individuals with ts or ocd and from controls was randomized across plates and genotyped using the illumina human610quad genotyping array additional unscreened controls that were genotyped as a part of the sage genotyped on illumina humanhap1mv1c and icontrol genotyped on illumina humanhap550v1v3 datasets were also included in this study to reduce effects of population stratification subjects were limited to those with genetically defined european ancestry based on principal components clustering analysis using genomewide pairwise identitybydescent ibd information as estimated with eigenstrat three point zero 32 and including previously defined european population samples as reference hapmap30
 
the first phase of quality control analyses including assessment of hardyweinberg equilibrium differential missingness platform effects population stratification and genotyping call rate was conducted as a part of the recently published gwas of ocd and ts 30 31 the variance components models in the reml analysis utilized all unpruned genotype data simultaneously because all genotypes are fitted together in a given variance component these components are particularly susceptible to minor technical and experimental artifacts that might only modestly affect each genotype ie in a snpbysnp test of association but could have a substantial cumulative global effect on the results from a mixed linear model we thus undertook additional more stringent quality control measures to minimize any possible persistent population stratification and experimental bias prior to casecontrol comparisons we first focused solely on the control dataset to develop our qc pipeline we split the controls by data source icontrol vs sage controls and performed the following qc steps using plink we implemented stringent thresholds and removed additional snps showing low levels of differential missingness between cases and controls p005 modest deviation from hardyweinberg expectation p005 and significant platform effect after adjustment for all ten principal components p0001 in addition individuals with genotype call rate 999 or with a high degree of relatedness pihat005 were removed table s1 to assess any residual crossplatform artifacts that might artificially elevate the heritability estimate we conducted a dummy casecontrol gwas by assigning case status to the icontrol data n  1104 and control status to the sage controls n  2190 we detected no significant association with platform phenotype by logistic regression figure s1 or heritability between crossplatform controls h2  106 se  011 table s2 additionally we analyzed ten permutations of the dummy case phenotype and detected no significant heritability in any permuted analysis in addition to these qc steps we examined the data for any possible residual population stratification or cryptic relatedness which is described in depth in the supplementary methods figures s1 s2 s3 s4 the quality control and matching steps resulted in a final data set of six hundred and seventeen ts cases and 4116 ts controls genotyped on 393387 snps as well as 1061 ocd cases and 4236 ocd controls genotyped on 373846 snps each analysis included the top twenty principal components as covariates
 
for each analysis presented gcta v12 5 wwwcomplextraitgenomicscom was used to create a genetic relationship matrix grm file containing ibd relationship calculations for all pairwise sets of individuals principal components were determined within gcta using all genotype data and the top twenty principal components were applied to each analysis the reml analysis was then performed using the respective grms and principal component quantitative covariates as this analysis was performed with dichotomous casecontrol traits it was necessary to convert the phenotypic variance to an underlying liability scale this conversion uses population prevalence to adjust for casecontrol ascertainment in the sample and to modify the phenotypic variance estimate accordingly 4 we conducted primary analyses using 25 for ocd prevalence and 08 for ts as a range of prevalence estimates for both ocd and ts are frequently reported we conducted additional sensitivity analyses to examine the heritability estimates for ts and ocd across a range of reported prevalences table s3 33 34 35 36 additionally we provide heritability results converted to the sibling relative risk scale for further interpretation table s4 we conducted three primary analyses univariate ts heritability univariate ocd heritability joint ocd and ts bivariate analysis and five exploratory analyses partitioning by chromosome maf genic annotation brain eqtl annotation age of onset for each primary analysis ten permutations of the phenotype were performed and gcta was run on each permutation to observe the stability of the heritability estimate
 
in addition we calculated the genetic correlation between ocd and ts using the gcta bivariate reml analysis we split the shared control sample between the ts cases and the ocd cases in a manner that preserved the matched ancestry structure and the proportion of cases to controls for each disorder an initial analysis included comorbid ts and ocd cases assigned to either the ts or ocd samples based on their primary diagnosis as determined by the clinical team we conducted a secondary bivariate analysis limiting the snps included to a subset of snps previously identified as regulators of gene expression in the brain a final sensitivity analysis was conducted after removing all three hundred and sixteen case samples with known overlapping comorbidity 83 ocd samples with ts or chronic tics and two hundred and thirtythree ts samples with ocd to assess the effect of comorbidity on the crossdisorder genetic correlation we then applied a likelihood ratio test lrt to determine the statistical significance of each genetic correlation
 
imputation was performed using impute v212 and the one thousand genomes project data as a reference panel only imputed snps that were in strong linkage disequilibrium ld info06 with genotyped snps and had a high certainty 90 of the predicted genotypes were retained imputed snps that showed significant genotyping platform effects were excluded imputed results were converted to mach format ie mldose mlinfo using an inhouse script mach dosage data was used to create grms for each chromosome chromosome specific grms were then merged as needed for additional analyses the total number of imputed snps after qc included 7657106 snps in both the ts and ocd samples
 
a separate grm was generated for each chromosome each grm was then run in separate reml analysis an additional analysis was conducted in which all chromosomes were modeled jointly in a single reml analysis
 
we chose not to employ a minor allele frequency maf cutoff in any of the heritability analyses this decision was based on the observation that minor allele frequency cutoffs did not alter estimates of heritability for the controlcontrol analysis after establishment of stringent differential missingness rates and call rate we partitioned the directly genotyped and imputed variants according to maf bin for the directly genotyped variants we created six bins representing mafs from 000105 00501 12 23 34 and 45 and generated grms for each bin for the imputed genotypes we created two bins representing maf 0001005 and 005 to zero point five and generated grms for each bin for each set of variants directly genotyped and imputed respectively we then combined binned grms in a single joint reml analysis allowing the effects of ld to be partitioned by the reml analytic approach
 
we annotated variants for genic and intergenic classification using annovar hg18 refgene 37 genic variants included all those variants annotated to exons introns utrs and splice sites intergenic variants included those not otherwise annotated as genic additionally we annotated directly genotyped and imputed snps that we had previously identified as significantly associated with gene expression p0001 in parietal cortex gse35977 cerebellum gse35974 and skeletal muscle gse40234 details of the eqtl detection are described in supplementary methods and in previous publications 3845 three sets of analyses were conducted using the eqtl annotations the first analysis simply partitioned the parietal eqtls and cerebellar eqtls from their respective complements for all imputed snps the second model included four partitions 1 brain only eqtls those found in cerebellum or parietal tissues but not in muscle 2 muscle only eqtls those found in muscle and not in either brain tissue 3 eqtls common to brain and muscle and 4 a final partition with noneqtl snps the last analysis included four total partitions to accommodate eqtls exclusive to each brain tissue cerebellum and parietal as well as eqtls found in both brain tissues and the remainder of all imputed snps annotations were applied to the ts and ocd casecontrol data and used to create partitions this resulted in a total of four separate annotationbased reml analyses for each analysis we created a single grm for each partition finally for each analysis we included the functional variant grms and the respective complement grm together in one joint reml analysis
 
multiple studies have reported significantly higher heritability for earlyonset ocd than for adult onset ocd 16 46 hanna and colleagues 2005 47 suggested a possible threshold of fourteen years to define earlyonset ocd however as our data was collected retrospectively potentially introducing a recall bias we chose to employ a conservative threshold for earlyonset of symptoms or diagnosis at age sixteen point we sought to test the hypothesis that earlyonset ocd is more highly heritable than adultonset ocd by dividing the ocd sample based on symptom onset or age at diagnosis 16  early onset 16  adultonset a total of seven hundred and thirtytwo cases were diagnosed or reported symptom onset prior to age sixteen and were considered early onset a total of two hundred and sixtyseven cases were diagnosed or exhibited symptoms later than age sixteen and were classified as adult onset age of onset data was missing for sixtytwo cases gcta analysis was performed on both subsets of samples

dna samples were genotyped on the affymetrix axiom chb array genotypes were called using affymetrix genotyping console individuals with call rate 95 or that were outliers following principal components analysis n  47 or related n  53 were removed leaving one thousand one hundred and eightynine cases and one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven controls for the main association study we selected snp variants with maf 1 call rate 90 and hwe p value 0001 in controls because of the near requirement for dqb10602 in narcolepsy an extended hla region from rs1419229 to rs9368865 chr 62411253735363736 was excluded from the primary association leaving 603382 autosomal nonhla snp variants the extended hla region contained 3000 snps and was analyzed separately for imputation of hla haplotypes and effects on clinical presentation
 
the majority of the analysis including quality control ld calculations quantitative trait association and interactions was performed using the plink suite of software v 107 35 to control for population stratification the association was performed using a variance component model implemented in emmax 36 cluster quality of top ranking snp markers was verified by visual examination of clusters as emmax does not return or or maf data these data were gathered and reported from corresponding analyses in plink inflation statistics were estimated and qq plots were generated using estlambda genabel package v174 in r 2153 37 38 in addition principal components was performed and manhattan plot generated using svs v7 goldenhelix
 
the top ranked one hundred and fifty snps from associations performed in emmax and plink a total of one hundred and eightyeight snps p0001 for emmax 0003 for plink were selected for followup after visual check and exclusion of sixteen poorly clustered snps we selected the topranked snp from each locus defined as two snps within one hundred kb resulting in eighty variants for replication in our previously published european cohorts affymetrix six point zero array study eight hundred and seven narcolepsy one thousand and seventyone controls illumina immunochip array study one thousand eight hundred and eightysix cases 10421 controls the affymetrix and illumina immunochip samples were partially overlapping and thus the replication was first done in the larger illumina immunochip sample if a variant was not present or tagged by variants on that array then replication was next attempted in the smaller affymetrix six point zero data set when a selected chb variant was not on the corresponding array an analysis of ld in a 1020 kb window was performed in chinese and europeans ensembl 1000genomes browser ld data to identify potential proxies with an r2 08 available on the immunochip or affymetrix six point zero array in the case of rs1551570 the variant was not tagged on either array but shows strong ld with rs2305795 a snp found to be associated with narcolepsy following fine mapping 7 where corresponding p values were extracted from the previous analysis a bonferroni correction was applied to determine significance

high resolution hla typing had been performed on a subset of two hundred and thirtynine narcolepsy cases and fourteen controls for hla drb1 dqa1 and dqb1 genes 3 all positive for dqb10602 these individuals were also genotyped on the axiom chb array see above in order to impute the hla genotypes for the rest of the data set the hla types together with arraygenotyped snps in a five hundred kb window surrounding hla drb1 dqa1 and dqb1 were submitted as a training set to hibag package in r hibag is an hla imputation tool that uses attribute bootstrap aggregation of several classifiers snps to select groups of snps that predict hla type 41 the resulting sets of haplotype predictive snps were then used to impute hla type in the remaining samples cases and controls allele frequencies of drb1 dqa1 and dqb1 alleles obtained after imputation was consistent with population data r2  096 42 imputation was acceptable in both dqb10602 positive and negative controls but in consideration of our training set we only used data from dqb10602 positive individuals which was imputed with better quality 850 in dqb10602 positive individuals and 775 in dqb10602 negative individuals imputation of dqb10301 dqb10602 and dqb10102 the alleles of principal interest in this study was highly accurate dqb10301 928 in controls 976 in cases dqb10602 905 in controls 974 in cases dqa10102 922 in controls 975 in cases in the data set the imputation quality may be overestimated in cases since the narcolepsy population is more homogenous for their hla haplotype
 
the imputed hla haplotype data was first used to study association between rs7744020 rs9274477 rs17212223 age of onset associated rs9271117 rs9270965 associated with onset prior versus after september 2009 and various hla genotypes table 2 to verify whether the hla association in narcolepsy versus controls was consistent with previous reports in other ethnic groups 1 including chinese subjects 3 n  one thousand one hundred and eightythree dqb10602 positive cases and n  four hundred and thirtyeight dqb10602 positive controls we next categorized subjects into five risk groups based on our prior model of allelic competition 3 1 dqb10602 homozygous highest risk 2 dqb10301 carriers second highest risk 3 dqa10102dqb105 or dqb106 non0602 intermediate 4 dqa101 nondqa10102 protective 5 alleles with no predisposition or protection effects for narcolepsy these categories were then compared using 2 square tests between cases versus controls and cases after versus before september two thousand and nine point 2 analyses were performed sequentially starting with dqb10602 homozygotes then moving on to dqb10301 carriers then to dqa10102dqb105 or dqb106 non0602 carriers and finally to dqa101 nondqa10102 carriers as previously reported 3 a technique similar to relative predisposition effect statistics 43

we used data from eight genomewide association studies gwas of european ancestry table 1 a three gwas of the genemsa 30 39 with samples from the netherlands genemsa du switzerland genemsa sw and the united states genemsa us b an early gwas from the imsgc 30 39 40 with samples from the united states ismgc us and the united kingdom imsgc uk that was collapsed in one stratum removing the uk cases c a gwas with cases from the brigham and womens hospital and controls from the migen study bwh 30 39 d the australia and new zealand multiple sclerosis genetics consortium anzgene 41 e an unpublished gwas set from erasmus medical center in rotterdam the netherlands and f an unpublished gwas collection from the kaiser permanente ms research program kaiser permanente all the above gwas data sets were filtered with the same quality control criteria as part of an ongoing metaanalysis of multiple sclerosis gwas in each of these data sets we performed principal components analysis pca to identify population outliers and to calculate covariates to control for population stratification between cases and controls
 
from each gwas we extracted snps within the extended mhc region chr629299390 to 33883424 hg18 to impute classical alleles for class i hla genes hlaa hlab and hlac and class ii hla genes hladpa1 hladpb1 hladqa1 hladqb1 and hladrb1 their corresponding amino acid sequences and snps not captured in the genotypic platforms used the imputation was performed with the software beagle 42 using a collection of 2767 individuals of the type one diabetes genetics consortium t1dgc with 4digit classical allele genotyping for the above hla genes as the reference panel this method and reference panel have been used for finemapping mhc associations in hiv control 8 and seropositive rheumatoid arthritis 38 cases and controls from each gwas dataset were imputed together all variants in the reference panel were coded as biallelic markers presence vs absence allowing us to use beagle for the imputation postimputation we excluded variants with minor allele frequency less than 1 from the analysis table s5 lists the imputation quality for the identified variants
 
we analyzed each variant using a logistic regression model assuming alleles have an additive effect on the logodds scale we also assumed the genetic effects were fixed across all eight gwas in each model we included the top five principal components to control for withingwas population stratification and seven dummy variables to account for betweengwas specific effects throughout the text we refer to such a model as univariate mu even if several covariates were included in the model reflecting the fact that only one mhcspecific variant is included in the model this is the representation of the univariate model1 mu univariate logistic regression model
 
where y is the logodds for the casecontrol status 0 is the logistic regression intercept and ij is the logadditive effect for the allele j of the variant i with p alleles in this paper the term variant is used for any type of snp biallelic triallelic etc twodigit hla allele fourdigit hla allele and amino acid position in any case we included p1 alleles with the one excluded being the reference allele where possible we tried to select the most frequent variant in the controls as the reference allele the five included principal components are represented in the model as l and the last block in the model represents the dummy variables included for the n studies n1 parameters added in the model
 
to calculate an omnibus pvalue for the variant regardless of the number of alleles included in the univariate model we used using a loglikelihood ratio test 2 comparing the likelihood l0 of the null model 3 against the likelihood l1 of the fitted model2loglikelihood ratio test
 
where d is the loglikelihood test value also known as deviance d follows an approximate chisquare distribution with k degrees of freedom where k is the difference of the regressed parameters between the two models representation of the null model3 m0 null logistic regression model
 
besides testing variants for association ie snps hla alleles and amino acids we also fitted models that estimated the overall effect of the each of the eight hla genes we did so by fitting all respective fourdigit alleles of a given hla gene in the same model the respective pvalues reflect the overall significance of the gene
 
in order to identify the statistically independent effects we first tested all variants under a univariate logistic regression model and ranked them based on the pvalue of the loglikelihood test next in a forward stepwise fashion we included in the logistic regression model the most statistically significant variant as a covariate analyzed all remaining variants and ranked them based on the new pvalue of the respective loglikelihood test the models that included at least one variant as covariate are referred to as conditional throughout the text in each iteration the null model used in the loglikelihood test was the original null model 3 with the variants that were used as covariates we repeated the same steps until no variant or no hla gene reached the level of statistical significance which we a priori set to be 105 this statistical significance threshold accounts of 5000 independent tests using bonferroni correction although most of the variants analyzed are correlated we chose this threshold to account also for the multiple stepwise fitted models if no variant reached the level of significance but an hla gene did we kept adding variants in the overall model until the hla gene pvalue was larger than 105
 
to compare the effects of two or more variants eg a and b we fitted the following models ma model with variant a mb model with variant b and mab model with both variants a and b all three model included the same other covariates then we used the loglikelihood test to compare mab vs mb and mab vs ma these two comparisons represent the effects of variants a and b respectively in the presence of the other variant ie b and a for these comparisons we used the nominal   005 level of statistical significance
 
after adjusting for the most statistically significant variant drb11501 the residual effect of the drb1 locus ie the effect of all alleles besides 1501 was still the most statistically significant of any of the remaining variants this led us to the hypothesis that several other drb1 alleles could explain the overall drb1 locus effect already conditioning on drb11501 to identify such effects inside the drb1 locus we applied the above forward stepwise logistic regression approach to the fourdigit drb1 alleles  to test the robustness of the results from the forward stepwise regression we also applied four other statistical methods for variant selection i lasso 43 ii elastic net 44 iii least angle regression 45 and iv forward stagewise regression 46 for the lasso and elastic net we selected the largest value of lambda l1 after 10fold crossvalidation such that error was within one standard error of the minimum mean crossvalidated error in the respective results section we illustrate that all methods reached the same conclusion independently
 
it has been proposed that extended drb11501dqb10602 haplotypes confer the risk for ms rather than individual hla alleles to test this hypothesis we used the postimputation phased data to estimate the drb11501dqb10602 diplotypes then we fitted a logistic regression that estimated the effect of the diplotype under a perallelic model since this approach used phased data rather than postimputation probabilities the imputation uncertainty is not properly accounted for thus we expect the respective pvalues to be slightly inflated

worm embryos were isolated by sodium hypochlorite treatment and eggs were transferred to plates and grown at the indicated temperature in a designated incubator the plates were scored two or three days later under a dissecting microscope for the presence of l2 dauer and l3l4 and older worms we conducted control experiments to determine the robustness and reproducibility of visual scoring by having several scorers evaluate a series of still images and corresponding movies of larvae of different developmental stages we then compared the correlation between the scorers for the entire series via the use of a kappa statistic 92 these experiments indicated that scoring was consistent between raters within the lab with all comparisons showing substantial to almost perfect agreement table s7 92
 
for each assay approximately one hundred worms were scored from each of two to three plates set up in parallel for each genotype used in an experiment this resulted in two hundred to more typically three hundred animals being scored for each genotype within an experiment each experiment was repeated at least once with comparable results which resulted in between 400600 worms being scored per genotype in total the percentages of each stage were graphed using prism5 software and the graphs show pooled data from a single trial to perform pairwise comparisons between mutant strains a contingency table was set up using the counts for l2 dauer and l3l4 categories and pvalues were calculated using fishers exact contingency test within sas version 93 to determine sds resistance worms were washed from plates with 1 sds and then incubated for twenty minutes with gentle rocking worms were then pelleted and washed with water aliquots were scored for survival as demonstrated by movement and each experiment was repeated at least once the percentages of living worms were graphed with prism5
 
lifespan assays were conducted as previously described at 20c using either nga or rnai plates containing fifty m fudr 93 lifespan assays for n2 tatn1baf1 eak7tm3188 and eak7tm3188 tatn1baf1 used nga plates spotted with hb101 and worms were grown from eggs at 16c to minimize larval arrest lifespan assays for n2 tatn1baf1 aak2gt33 and tatn1baf1 aak2gt33 used nga plates spotted with hb101 lifespan assays for amino acid treated n2 worms used either nga plates or nga plates supplemented with one mgml tyrosine glycine or isoleucine and then spotted with hb101 lifespan assays using daf2 and daf16 rnai treatment used nga media supplemented with carbenicillin 50 gml and isopropyl dthiogalactopyranoside iptg one mm rnai treatment for daf16 was started at egg hatching while daf2 rnai treatment started on day one of adulthood with larval development occurring on nga plates spotted with hb101 at 20c
 
for all lifespan assays three plates containing forty worms each for each genotype were set up as well as an extra plate with worms to replace worms that had crawled off the plate bagged or exploded to reduce the number of censored events prism5 graphpad software was used to generate graphs and perform logrank testing for curve comparisons sas was used to create lifetables and calculate mean survival
 
amino acids sigmaaldrich were dissolved as fortyfive mgml stock solutions in water and then added to molten ngm to obtain a one mgml final concentration these plates were dried and spotted with hb101 before use
 
worms were grown on hb101 spotted ngm plates for two days at 25c before being washed from the plates and then being rinsed twice with miliq water for figure s9a ngm plates either with or without one mgml tyrosine cast into the agar were used to grow the worm culture to normalize the samples for worm number a five l aliquot was removed and scored for worm number amino acids were then extracted using aqueous methanol and crushing with a mortar and pestle as previously described 94 the methanol solution was removed by evaporation and the residue stored frozen at 80c amino acid analysis was performed via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry following reconstitution of the residue in zero point one ml water as described previously for urine 95 amino acid content was then either normalized to total worm number in the sample figure 9b figure 9c and figure s9a or normalized to the levels of individual nonaromatic amino acids and then divided by the average normalized level observed in the wildtype n2 samples figure 9d
 
aliquots from a two hundred and fifty mm aicar solution dissolved in water cell signaling technology were spotted onto nga plates spotted with hb101 to give a final concentration of zero point one two five mm one hour before eggs were added to the plates a comparable volume of water alone was used as a negative control
 
worm embryos were isolated by sodium hypochlorite treatment from n2 and eak4mg348 tatn1baf1 adults and the eggs were transferred to nga plates spotted with hb101 the plates were incubated at 25c for twentyfour hours so most of the population was l2 larvae the worms were washed from plates with water and washed with water to remove bacteria nucleotides were then extracted from the worms as previously described 50 the resulting extract was stored at 80c until analysis atp adp and amp levels were measured by hplc with uv detection of individual nucleotides
 
images of worms were obtained with a bx51 fluorescence microscope and quantified using imagej software as previously described 44
 
for sod3 expression worm embryos were isolated by sodium hypochlorite treatment and eggs were transferred to nga plates spotted with hb101 and incubated at 25c for twentyfour hours the worms were washed from plates in water pelleted by centrifugation washed with water and frozen for storage rna extraction reverse transcription and quantitative pcr were performed as previously described 27 44 the geometric mean level of the control genes pmp3 cdc42 and y45f10d4 were used to normalize the samples and the relative levels of sod3 expression were determined using the 2ct approach 96 97
 
for tatn1 expression n2 and daf2e1368 embryos were isolated by sodium hypochlorite treatment and eggs were transferred to sbasal to arrest the worms at the l1 stage l1 larvae were added to nga plates spotted with op501 and the plates were incubated at 20c for three days adult worms were washed from plates and rna was isolated as described above the geometric mean level of the control genes pmp3 cdc42 and y45f10d4 were used to normalize the samples and the relative levels of tatn1 expression were determined using the 2ct approach 96 97

n2 wildtype control and tatn1qd182 mutant worms were synchronized via the use of hypochlorite treatment and grown on hb101 spotted ngm plates at 25c for two days these conditions and time point correspond to the conditions used for the amino acid analysis separately performed using these strains the worms were washed from the plates and were then washed twice with miliq water the worm pellet was then suspended in qiazol lysis reagent qiagen valencia ca and frozen at 80c total rna was isolated using the qiagen mirneasy mini kit and the rna yield was measured by spectrophotometry total rna was sent to expression analysis durham nc for analysis including bioanalyzer electrophoresis to ensure rna quality followed by library preparation using the illumina truseq rna sample prep kit the resulting library was subjected to highthroughput fifty nucleotide paired end sequencing using an illumina sequencer at a depth of seventeen million reads per sample
 
the resulting sequence data was clipped using internally developed software from expression analysis and matched to the c elegans genome using rsem 101 the resulting transcript counts were then normalized using the upper quartile normalization approach 102 differentially expressed genes were then identified through the use of anova testing and genes with a fdr score of 5 or lower were considered to be differentially expressed this lead to the identification of four thousand six hundred and twentytwo genes as being differentially expressed 890 upregulated and three thousand seven hundred and thirtytwo downregulated between tatn1qd182 and wildtype n2
 
overrepresented gene classes were identified in the upregulated and downregulated genes through the use of david 60 analysis of the transcriptome data for daf16foxo and crh1creb regulated genes was performed using the gene set association analysis for rnaseq program available at  63 gsaa calculates a differential expression score for each gene in the entire rnaseq dataset twenty thousand four hundred and eight genes in all and then uses a running weighted kolmogorovsmirnov test to examine association of an entire gene set with each phenotypic class the strength of the association is measured by the association score as where positive scores indicate association of the gene set with the phenotype and statistical significance is measured by a false discovery rate fdr that is adjusted for multiple testing the daf16foxo regulated genes were from previously published microarray data from murphy et al and the crh1creb regulated genes were from recently published microarray data from mair et al 53 62

mcf7 mdamb231 and 293t cells were obtained from the american type culture collection and cultured at 37c 5 co2 in dulbeccos modified eagle mediumnutrient mixture f12 dmemf12 media containing 10 fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillinstreptomycin
 
damid lentiviral vectors plgwrfc1v5ecodam and plgwv5ecodam were kindly provided by dr bas van steensel netherlands cancer institute human mbd3 cdna bc043619 was amplified and cloned into pentrdtopo and then recombined by an lrreaction into destination vector plgwrfc1v5ecodam plgwmbd3v5ecodam retroviral knockdown constructs psmpluc addgene plasmid 36394 and psmpmbd33 addgene plasmid 36373 were obtained from addgene all constructs were verified by dna sequencing lentivirus production and infection were performed as previously described 40 using plgwmbd3v5ecodam mbd3dam or plgwv5ecodam damonly retrovirus production and infection were performed as described 41 using psmpluc or psmpmbd33
 
the damid experiments were carried out as previously described 42 briefly mcf7 or mda 231 cells were seeded into 6well plates seventytwo hrs after infection genomic dna was isolated using qiagen dneasy tissue kit genomic dna 25 g was digested with dpn i followed by adaptor ligation the ligated product was digested with dpn ii and amplified by pcr one microgram amplified product was labeled using dualcolor dna labeling kit nimblegen according to manufacturers protocol and then hybridized to nimblegen 21m deluxe promoter array or human two point one m wholegenome tiling array array five of ten covering chromosomes 68 and washed following the manufacturers directions the slides were scanned using a dna microarray scanner g2565ba agilent technology and the images were processed with the nimblegen software
 
a twostep normalization approach was used where the first step is designed to correct for gc bias and dye bias within a chip intrachip correction and the second step corrects for variations across chips interchip correction the first step was withinchip normalization first all probes were binned according to their gc content the gc content was computed as a ratio of c and g nucleotides to the total number of nucleotides in the probe sequence the overall variability in gc content values was used to compute bin width according to zerostage rule 43 44 these bin widths are proven to be approximate l2 optimal ie they minimize mean integrated square error the bins with fewer probes were then merged so that each bin contains at least five hundred probes within each bin lowess regression was used to predict logtransformed cy5 values as a smooth function of logtransformed cy3 values 45 46 the scaled median of absolute residuals is used for scaling difference between observed and predicted logcy5 values were used as normalized signal
 
the second step was betweenchip normalization once the data were corrected for dye and gc bias as described in the first step we employed quantile normalization independently for each histone mark and dna methylation to correct for betweenchip variation
 
the differentially bound peak regions for each cell type comparisons were identified using modified acme algorithm that allows for spooling data across replicates 46 this algorithm like acme depends on three userspecified tuning parameters window size w signal threshold s and pvalue threshold p
 
to identify mbd3 bound peaks we first compute the number x of signal values within window of size w centered at probe that are greater than 100s th percentile across all replicates next we compute enrichment pvalue for probe using hypergeometric distribution as followingwhere n denotes total number of probes k denotes number of probes in window and r denotes the number of replicates
 
finally the peaks are identified as runs of enrichment pvalues that are less than pvalue threshold p the analysis presented here correspond to signal threshold s  095 window size w  2000 and pvalue threshold p  0001 with peaks containing less than six probes excluded
 
for each set of differentially bound and cellspecific gene signatures we performed fishers exact test to assess enrichment of genesets from molecular signature database msigdb version30 broad institute and other published cancer gene sets the resulting significance pvalues were subjected to benjaminhochberg fdr multiple test correction
 
we employed chromosome bound circular permutations test described in 46 to assess whether the observed overlap between two sets of genomic intervals eg peaks is significantly enriched or depleted compared to expected overlap to perform overlap analysis we used disjoined probes from the promoterarray as a unit of overlap the member status ie whether the disjoined probe belongs to a genomic region of interest or not of disjoined promoter probes in one of genomic interval set was permuted 20000 times using chromosome bound circular permutation as following for each permutation a randomly generated number drawn from uniform distribution between one and number of disjoined probes from the analyzed chromosome was used to shift the membership status of all disjoined probes within a chromosome the permutations resumed at the beginning of chromosome when the shift of status exceeded number of disjoined probes available in a chromosome the oddsratio of enrichmentdepletion corresponding significance pvalue and 95 confidence interval were calculated by comparing observed overlaps and average overlap across all 20000 permutations
 
the above approach was utilized to assess enrichmentdepletion of overlap in significant damid peaks modified acme peaks with at least six promoter probes and mbd3 chipseq peaks peaks with fold change  two and false discovery rate  000001
 
we also utilized the above approach to assess enrichmentdepletion of overlap in significant cell specific damid peaks uncommon peaks in mcf7 and mda231 cells with promoter regions 3 kb upstream and three kb downstream of tss of luminal vs basal breast cancer differentially expressed genes from charafe et al 47

we selected six samples for genome sequencing and generated single end and long mate pair solid reads we generated additional paired end pe sequence data on the illumina hiseq platform text s1 for most downstream analyses we also utilized sequence information from the boxer reference genome canfam 30
 
we aligned sequence reads to canfam 30 with postprocessing of aligned reads including the removal of duplicates local realignment and base quality recalibration text s3 we then genotyped each sample individually using the genome analysis toolkit gatk pipeline 34 for snv genotyping and analysis we excluded repeats of recent origin cpg sites regions falling in copy number variants and triallelic sites and at the sample level we filtered out genotypes proximate to called indels with excess depth of coverage with low genotype quality scores or where the snv fell within five base pairs of another snv text s4
 
we compared genotype calls based upon sequencing to those from the same samples using the illumina caninehd beadchip which consists of 17000 markers evenly spaced throughout the dog genome text s5 we also analyzed variants overlapping those generated in a previous snp array study of a large panel of dogs and wolves 10 and performed pca on the combined data set to verify that ngs genotypes clustered with array genotypes for the same lineages text s5
 
we delineated segmental duplications in our six genomes by identifying regions with a significant excess depth of coverage text s6 for this purpose we aligned illumina and solid reads with mrfast 35 and drfast 36 respectively absolute copy numbers were calculated using mrcanavar version zero point three one  in the particular case of the previously reported amy2b expansion in the dog lineage 15 we also examined patterns of copy number across fiftytwo breed dogs six dingoes and forty wolves using qpcr text s6
 
in order to conduct demographic analyses on putatively neutral genomic regions without any apparent functional annotation we first identified genic region using annotations from the union of refgene ensembl and seqgene annotation databases with the condition that all annotated transcripts had proper start and stop codons and contained no internal stop codons text s7 in addition we defined conserved noncoding elements cnes on the basis of phastcons scores 37 text s7

to investigate the extent of gene flow between wolves and dogs subsequent to their divergence we employed a method recently developed by durand et al 18 this method tests for directional gene flow by testing for asymmetries in allele sharing between a source lineage p3 and either of two receiving lineages p1 p2 with reference to an outgroup o to focus on gene flow most germane to evolutionary processes influencing wolfdog divergence we restricted testing to those cases where one of the dog samples was p3 the other two p1 and p2 were wolves and viceversa p3  wolf p1 and p2  dogs for more details see text s8
 
our main demographic analysis is based on the generalized phylogenetic coalescent sampler gphocs developed by gronau et al 19 and which we applied to 16434 one kb loci chosen via a strict set of criteria to obtain putatively neutral loci text s9 the prior distributions over model parameters was defined by a product of gamma distributions using the default setting chosen by gronau et al 19 markov chain was run for 100000 burnin iterations after which parameter values were sampled for 200000 iterations every ten iterations resulting in a total of 20001 samples from the approximate posterior convergence was inspected manually for each run we conditioned inference on the population phylogeny based upon the neighborjoining tree constructed from the genomewide distance matrix described above fig 4a we also constructed models under a regional domestication scenario in which each dog lineage originated from a wolf lineage from the same geographic region ie basenji from israeli wolf boxer from croatian wolf and dingo from chinese wolf we assessed models in which the branch ancestral to dogs was sister to a particular extant wolf population or one of internal branches in the wolf clade in addition we investigated the sensitivity of parameter estimates to choice of locus length number of loci intralocus recombination distance from coding exons and selection on linked sites for more details see text s9

we obtained genomic dna samples processed at the finnish institute of molecular medicine nfbc and us national human genome research institute fusion all nfbc and fusion participants included in this study provided informed consent the studies were carried out in accordance with the approvals of the ethical committee of the northern ostrobothnia hospital district for nfbc and the university of michigan health sciences and behavioral sciences institutional review board irbhsbs and the institutional review board of the national public health institute ktl now part of the national institute for health and welfare thl for fusion
 
we constructed illumina multiplexed libraries with five g of whole genome amplified material see text s1 for description of amplification procedures or one g native genomic dna according to the manufacturers protocol illumina inc san diego ca with the following modifications 1 dna was fragmented using a covaris e220 dna sonicator covaris inc woburn ma to between one hundred and four hundred bp 2 illumina adapterligated library fragments were amplified in four fifty l pcr reactions for eighteen cycles 3 solid phase reversible immobilization bead cleanup was used for enzymatic purification throughout the library construction process and for final library size selection targeting 300500 bp fragments samples were multiplexed using illumina barcoded libraries pooled together in pools of twelve or eighteen depending on the sequencing platform we designed a custom targeted set of one hundred and fifty bp probes agilent technologies santa clara ca and captured 270 kb of primarily coding sequence from seventyeight genes the concentration of each captured library pool was determined through qpcr according to the manufacturers protocol kapa biosystems inc woburn ma to produce cluster counts appropriate for the illumina gaiix and hiseq two thousand platforms
 
sample pools of twelve and eighteen were loaded on gaiix and hiseq machines respectively using paired end one hundred and one bp read lengths we aimed to achieve a coverage metric of 80 of the targeted space covered at 20 depth we aligned reads from each sample to the ncbi37hg19 reference sequence using bwa 31 sample identity was confirmed by comparing sequence data samtools consensus calls with preexisting genotype array data individuals with 70 coverage at 20 and 90 genotype concordance with fiftyone array snps were included in the analysis 6123 of 6958 individuals
 
details on sequencing and generation of centerspecific genotype call sets can be found in text s1 to generate a consensus call set we pooled together all quality controlled sites discovered by any of the three centers ucla university of michigan or washington university in the defined target loci number of markers m  2306 we excluded multiallelic sites or sites with different alternative alleles m  72 each center then recalled snp genotypes at the remaining sites m  2234 majority vote was used to generate variant calls genotypes concordant between at least two centers were included in the consensus data set others were set to missing the overall concordance rate between centers was 9996 9999 9994 and 9995 for homozygous reference heterozygous and homozygous alternative genotypes respectively
 
nfbc individuals were previously genotyped on the illumina 370duo chip and all fusion cases and seven hundred and seventyfour of nine hundred and nineteen fusion controls on the illumina humanhap300 beadchip version 10 after standard quality control procedures 6 7 highquality gwas genotypes were available for 296978 snps for all genotyped individuals we used plink 32 to identify 122644 snps with no more than moderate pair wise linkage disequilibrium r205 which we used to calculate genetic principal components pcs with eigenstrat 33
 
we applied logarithm transformations to bmi whr tg glucose insulin and sbp to reduce skewness for each phenotype or its logarithm data from the two studies combined were regressed on age age2 and indicator variables for sex oral contraceptive use pregnancy status and cohort and residuals from this regression used in association analyses t2d cases were excluded from analysis of fg and fi analyses were repeated using inverse normal transformed variables and our conclusions were robust to choice of transformation
 
we tested variants with minor allele frequency maf01 for association with phenotype residuals in the combined nfbcfusion data set assuming an additive genetic model and including the first five pcs as covariates using plink 32 we used conditional analyses to determine if singlesnp associations were independent of genotypes at the array snp teslovich et al in a previous gwas metaanalysis of lipid traits identified at several loci associations independent of their gwas signals 8 we sought to evaluate at all such gwas loci highlighted by teslovich et al the correlation between the signals identified through our conditional analyses and the independent signals detected by teslovich et al we could not make a direct comparison because at most loci the two studies did not have data on the same sets of variants we instead used imputed data from finnish reference populations to evaluate pairwise ld between the variants from our study that we compared with the variants from teslovich et al in this comparison we considered any pair of variants with r2020 to be independent
 
we conducted genelevel tests for phenotype residuals for each gene using nonsynonymous variants with maf1 only individuals with complete genotype data for all variant sites were used in a given genelevel test of each gene sample size for genelevel tests ranged from 4651 to 5376 individuals there were sixtytwo genes with 1 nonsynonymous variant site with maf1 the number of such sites ranged from two to thirtythree per gene
 
we used the combined multivariate and collapsing cmc 22 test that uses a weightedsumscorebased linear model to test the collective effect of multiple rare variants within a gene see text s1 for more information on the form of the weighting method used we also employed the sequence kernel association test skat 23 which assumes that the effect sizes for individual variants follow an arbitrary distribution with zero mean and an unknown variance skat uses a scorebased variance component approach to test the null hypothesis that the effect size distribution has zero variance for both cmc and skat we used the first five pcs as covariates
 
for skat we used asymptotic theory pvalues which conformed well to pvalues estimated by permutation data not shown for the cmc we estimated pvalues based on 10000 permutations of the phenotype data to estimate the pvalue for the abca1 association we performed 1000000 permutations
 
we employed fdr controlling procedures 24 over the entire set of singlevariant and genelevel tests we conducted testing of each phenotype against variantsgenes in loci to which the phenotype had prior association resulted in 2096 tests 1802 singlevariant tests and two hundred and ninetyfour genelevel tests fdr control at the zero point zero five level resulted in a pvalue cutoff of 0004 and we opted to use a somewhat more stringent pvalue threshold of zero point zero zero one corresponding to a fdr of 002
 
we used a standard model selection approach to analyze the thirtynine locusphenotype combinations and derive the best multivariate linear model for each phenotype based on all variants at the locus we excluded singletons from this analysis because the absence of any replication in the study sample renders inference on their effect impossible without making strong parametric assumptions as a default model selection approach we used the bayesian information criterion bic using a greedy search built into r stepaic we again included only complete observations in each locusphenotype combination for each locus the model with the smallest number of predictor variables included the first five pcs and the model with the largest number of predictor variables included all nonsingleton variants genotyped

for the tpoab gwas stage one and two analyses and the hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism and goiter analyses individuals were recruited from sixteen independent communitybased and family studies for the graves disease analyses cases were recruited from the united kingdom graves disease cohort and controls from the british one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight birth cohort thyroid cancer cases and controls were recruited from the nijmegen and ohio thyroid cancer cohorts a detailed description of the original cohorts contributing samples is provided in table one and in the supplementary material all participants provided written informed consent and protocols were approved by the institutional review boards or research ethics committees at the respective institutions and conducted according to the declaration of helsinki
 
serum tpoab levels were determined with a range of assays tpoabpositives were defined as subjects with tpoab levels above the assayspecific tpoabpositivity cutoff as defined by the manufacturer table 1 serum tsh and free thyroxine ft4 levels were determined using a range of assays table 1 assayspecific tsh and ft4 reference ranges were used as provided by the manufacturer table 1 overt hypothyroidism was defined as a high tsh ie a tsh level above the tsh reference range and a low ft4 increased tsh was defined as a high tsh including persons with overt hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism ie high tsh with a normal ft4 overt hyperthyroidism was defined as a low tsh and a high ft4 decreased tsh was defined as a low tsh including persons with subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism
 
the diagnosis of goiter is described in the supplementary material and the diagnosis of graves disease and thyroid cancer in the respective cohorts have been described previously 41
 
samples were genotyped with a range of gwas genotyping arrays supplementary table s1 sample and snp quality control procedures were undertaken within each study for each gwas over two point five million snps were imputed using ceu samples from phase two of the international hapmap project wwwhapmaporg genotyping procedures in the stage 2 graves disease and thyroid cancer populations are described in the supplementary material
 
the heritabilities of tpoabpositivity and serum tpoab levels were estimated as described in the supplementary material
 
in stage 1 we performed a gwas on tpoabpositivity as well as a gwas on continuous tpoab levels persons taking thyroid medication were excluded each snp was tested for association with tpoabpositivity using logistic regression analyses adjusting for age and sex for cohorts with family structure we approximated the probability of being affected with a linear mixed model adjusting for age and sex the produced model was used to predict the expected proportion of risk effective alleles in cases and controls hence giving the means to estimate odds ratios only unrelated individuals were considered for the sardinia cohort for the gwas of continuous tpoab levels samples with a tpoab level lower than the minimum tpoab assay detection limit table 1 were excluded tpoab levels were natural logtransformed and sexspecific age adjusted standardized residuals were calculated each snp was tested for association with these tpoab level residuals using linear regression analyses additive model correcting for relatedness in studies with family structure see supplementary table s1 for the software used for these analyses

in stage 2 we followedup stage one gwas significant snps as well as promising snps not reaching gwas significance in an attempt to reach gwas significant associations by increasing sample size supplementary material results from stage one and two were combined in a population size weighted zscore based metaanalysis using metal 71 a zscore based metaanalysis was used to reduce bias that might be induced by different assays as this method does not provide betas and we wanted to provide a rough estimate of the actual effect sizes for convenience we calculated betas using the fixed effects inverse variance based metaanalysis method heterogeneity was tested applying bonferroni based pvalue thresholds of p  zero point zero zero four for the tpoabpositivity analyses and p  zero point zero zero five for the tpoab level analyses
 
all studies assessed and if present corrected for population stratification using principalcomponent analysis pca andor multidimensionalscaling mds with the exception of sardinia and valborbera where the high isolation substantiates a lack of stratification table s1 72 73 lambda values were all 1 indicating that population stratification was overall properly accounted for table s1 to fully remove residual effects we applied genomic correction to studies were lambda was 1 the final metaanalyses reported a lambda of one point zero one for both the tpoabpositivity and the tpoab level gwas thus no genomic correction was applied
 
the variances explained by the gwas significant snps were calculated we subsequently studied the individual as well as the combined effects of the gwas significant snps on the risk of clinical thyroid disease as specified in the supplementary material in short to study combined effects a genetic risk score was calculated for every person as the weighted sum of tpoab risk alleles the associations between the individual snps genetic risk scores and the risk of abnormal thyroid function tests were studied using logistic regression analyses logistic regression analyses were used to study the associations with goiter graves disease and thyroid cancer supplementary material the results of each study were combined in a population size weighted zscore based metaanalysis using metal 71
 
various bioinformatic tools were searched for evidence for functional relevance of the gwas significant snps and pathway analyses were performed on the stage one lead snps see supplementary material

participants included in these analyses were from the howard university family study hufs which has been described in detail previously 48 briefly the hufs followed a populationbased selection strategy designed to be representative of african american families living in the washington dc metropolitan area ethnicity was ascertained by selfreport the hufs was approved by the howard university institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki all participants provided written informed consent
 
there were one thousand six hundred and ninetyfour individuals included in the study after application of exclusion criteria extreme phenotype values hdlc20 or 100 mgdl tg20 or 500 mgdl and missing covariate data age body mass index bmi and gender given known perturbations to serum lipids that cooccur with type two diabetes subjects with fasting blood glucose 126 mgdl or taking physicianprescribed diabetes medication were excluded these data include related participants family members were included in the common variant analysis where adjustment for the random effect of family was possible further description below for the rv analysis only unrelated family members were included with one randomlyselected individual from each family total n  919
 
serum measurements were made on fasting samples hdlc and tg were determined enzymatically with the cobas integra four hundred plus analyzer roche diagnostics indianapolis in methods were standardized to inhouse and other appropriate reference methods cdc reference methods for hdlc isotope dilutionmass spectrometry idms for tg by the manufacturer
 
fortyeight unrelated subjects were selected from the hufs with twentyfour from the favorable lipid profile category lowest tg quartile highest hdlc quartile and twentyfour from the unfavorable lipid profile category highest tg quartile lowest hdlc quartile a sample of fortyeight individuals 96 chromosomes provides a 99 probability of finding a sequence variant with a minor allele frequency maf of 005 86 probability of finding a variant with an maf of zero point zero two and 62 probability of finding a variant with an maf of 001 the sequencing strategy applied methods as previously described 49 briefly we sequenced known or predicted exons including five bp of the flanking introns 1 kb of the 5 untranslated region utrpromoter region and the 3 utr if it is evolutionarily conserved we also sequenced up to three of the most evolutionarily conserved regions of each gene that are not captured by the above features sequencing primers were designed to allow for sufficient overlap in individual sequencing reads florescent dyeterminator chemistry was used for bidirectional dna sequencing and sequence delineation was performed by automated abi prism 3730xl dna sequencers which typically give 650 bp q20phred20 read lengths mutations and heterozygotes were scored by automated comparative analysis against the provided reference sequence all mutations were confirmed by manual curation
 
sequence variants were selected based on frequency 2 to exclude variants that were only observed once which may reflect error for genotyping in the full hufs sample one hundred and seventyfour of these identified variants were available from previous genotyping in this sample using the affymetrix genomewide human snp array six point zero 48 primers were designed for an additional one hundred and three snps table s4 and genotyping was performed using the iplex gold assay on the massarray platform sequenom san diego ca as previously described 50 briefly the pcr and extension primers were designed using massarray designer software snps were excluded for assay failure n  19 lack of variation n  13 and genotype success rate 90 n  24 after these exclusions none of the variants failed the filter for departure from hardyweinberg equilibrium pvalue0000001
 
as our goal was to analyze the variation present in these genes in the individuals with extreme lipid profiles as comprehensively as possible the list of variants identified by sequencing strategies was augmented by variants identified for these individuals from previous gwas and by imputation based on one thousand genomes dataset imputation was performed using machadmix 51 an imputation tool specifically designed for use in admixed samples using a cosmopolitan reference panel based on one thousand genomes data imputed variants were filtered on an r2 of 03 rare variants with a maf001 were excluded due to diminished confidence in imputation in variants below this threshold
 
with previous n  174 and new n  47 genotyping and imputation n  1194 there were a total of 1415 variants were analyzed table s5 these included nine hundred and twentyone common variants cvs maf  005 and four hundred and ninetyfour less common or rare variants rvs maf  005 distributed as follows within the candidate genes abca1 636 cvs three hundred and eightynine rvs lcat 6 cvs two rv lpl 139 cvs fortyeight rvs pon1 110 cvs thirtythree rvs and serpine1 30 cvs twentytwo rvs
 
tg was logtransformed but the distribution of hdlc was approximately normal and left untransformed principal component analysis to assess population structure in the admixed african americans was conducted using eigensoft 52 and as reported previously 53 the first principal component was retained on the basis of velicers minimum average partial test and included in all analyses as a covariate representing overall proportion of african ancestry all analyses were also adjusted for age body mass index bmi and gender and p005 after multiple test correction was considered statistically significant all snp effects are described in terms of the minor allele thus an inverse association indicates that the minor allele was associated with decreasing phenotypic values relative to the major allele
 
separate analytical strategies were employed for the analysis of common variants cvs and rare variants rvs variants with maf  zero point zero five were included in the common variant cv analysis for the cv analysis the associations between variants and phenotypes were assessed in linear mixed models proc mixed in sas nine point three sas institute cary nc with adjustment for age bmi gender and the overall proportion african ancestry as well as random clustering within families for each variant models were run for additive dominant recessive and heterosis coding to correct for the number of snps tested pvalues were adjusted for the effective number of snps based on ld06 within the gene evaluated as previously described 54 briefly this method involves conducting a covariance matrix for all of the variants within a gene using this covariance to determine the ldadjusted number of independent tests that were conducted when analyzing all of the variants in that gene and multiplying the individual pvalues by that correction factor
 
all variants with maf005 were included in the less common and rare variant analysis hereafter referred to as the rare variant rv analysis for the rv analysis skat was used  55 skat aggregates individual score tests statistics for a set of snps returning a pvalue for the set in our implementation each gene only unrelated participants were included all unrelated and one randomlyselected individual from each family n  919 skat accommodates adjustment for covariates and all analyses were adjusted as in the cv analysis for age bmi gender and overall proportion african ancestry bootstrap resampling under the null model considering covariates was conducted and statistical significance for the rv analysis was declared after correction for a familywise error rate of 005

we performed genotyping of the hlaabc following the pcrssop sequencespecific oligonucleotide probing typing protocol and pcrsbt sequence based typing recommended by the 13th international histocompatibility workshop  all hla class i genotypes were defined to 4digit resolution with the exceptions of a74012 c17 and c18 which were determined to 2digits
 
lilrb2hla binding scores were defined in a previously described experiment 22 briefly a set of lilrfc fusion proteins was tested for binding with labscreen hla class i sabs at a concentration of 05 one and two m the level of binding was assessed by measuring the median fluorescence intensity mfi of the lilrfc bound to the beads using appropriate normalizations which included subtraction of the fcnegative control mfi and division of the result by the mfi of w632 monoclonal antihla class i antibodies recognizing 2massociated hla molecules the normalized values were assigned to each hla allotype as binding scores each binding score is a function of avidity of bivalent lilrb2fc for hla which in turn depends on the affinity of monomeric lilrb to hla therefore the binding score can be used as a quantitative characteristic of the strength of lilrhla interactions the relative lilr binding to different hla allotypes was similar at each of the lilr concentrations tested figure s4 this consistency between lilr concentrations assured us that the difference in mfis between the allotypes is mainly due to difference in binding strength and is not an experimental artifact the one m concentration results were chosen as a representative dataset among the hiv1infected patients used for the analyses frequencies of the hlaabc alleles with unknown binding scores were 21124 in white and 81339 in black patients to avoid power loss we used mean values for the corresponding locus for each genotype with unknown score the pairs of alleles a74012 and b8101 differ only at the signal peptide therefore they were treated as individual alleles in the context of lilrb2 binding

we analyzed family history data for a large number of cases of breast cancer to compare the risk of breast cancer in the maternal versus the paternal grandmother the sister study 17 enrolled 50884 women aged thirtyfive to seventyfour in the united states and puerto rico between two thousand and four and 2009 each had a sister diagnosed with breast cancer the unaffected sisters are being followed for newly incident breast cancer and other conditions participants completed a detailed family history questionnaire and were old enough that the data effectively encompass their grandmothers lifetime risks the sister study secured informed consent and was carried out with humansubjects approval and oversight from the niehs institutional review board and the copernicus group institutional review board
 
to assess asymmetry we calculated odds ratios which approximate the relative risks for maternal versus paternal grandmothers using families where exactly one of the two grandmothers had breast cancer ie discordant grandmother pairs
 
using algebra we then derived formulae to assess the likely strength of the mechanisms that could underlie an observed asymmetry in family history foreseeing applications beyond breast cancer we similarly derived expressions to assess the degree of asymmetry that those nonstandard mechanisms would produce in maternal versus paternal progenitors and the degree of asymmetry produced in the offspring of affected male versus female individuals

recombineering using ssdna can be very efficient with up to 75 of the cells being recombinants 83 therefore recombineering with ssdna can be used to isolate and map mutations and these techniques were used throughout this work for example when mutagenic pcr was used to isolate zipa mutations in one case sequencing revealed a double mutation zipaa245tq290r we designed and ordered oligonucleotides to make each mutation separately via recombineering recombineeringproficient cells prepared on cc4506 were transformed with each oligonucleotide separately or both together outgrown for thirty minutes then diluted and spottitered on lb plates at 30c and 42c we found that only one of the oligonucleotides mh82 was necessary and sufficient to create a mutation that suppressed kildependent killing
 
cells used for spot titers were taken from the same cultures used for fixation unless as noted below a tenfold dilution of these cultures was taken approximately forty minutes after induction or control conditions unless otherwise noted and then serially diluted into fresh lb media in a 96well plate using a multichannel pipette a flamesterilized and cooled metalpronged tool was then used to replicaplate spots of serially diluted culture onto lb plates with added components and incubation conditions as indicated in the text and figures photos of plates were taken in a fluorochem eight thousand eight hundred system with its accompanying camera and software alpha innotech

we used 1543 samples in total including two hundred and thirtyfour samples from 3 and four hundred and twentyfive samples from 4 see table s1 we selected samples that had fewer than 10 missing genotypes and for breeds with fewer than twenty genotyped samples we used all available samples which passed the missing genotype data threshold when pedigree data were absent for a breed the twenty samples with the highest genotype call rates were selected for breeds which had pedigree information we filtered any animals whose sire or dam was also genotyped for identified halfsiblings we sampled only the sibling with the highest genotype call rate after removing genotyped animals known to be closely related we selected the twenty animals with the highest genotype call rate to represent the breed all dna samples were collected in an ethical manner under university of missouri acuc approved protocol seven thousand five hundred and five point
 
samples were genotyped with the illumina bovinesnp50 beadchip 56 autosomal snps and a single pseudoautosomal snp were analyzed because the data set from gautier et al 4 excluded snps located exclusively on the x chromosome we also filtered all snps which mapped to chromosome unknown of the umd31 assembly 57 in plink 58 59 we removed snps with greater than 10 missing genotypes and with minor allele frequencies less than zero point zero zero zero five 12number of samples  0000324 thus the minor allele had to be observed at least once in our data set the average total genotype call rate in the remaining individuals was 0993 genotype data were deposited at dryad doi105061dryadth092 60
 
the sample genotype covariance matrix was decomposed using smartpca part of eigensoft four point two 19 to limit the effects of linkage disequilibrium on the estimation of principal components for each snp the residual of a regression on the previous two snps was input to the principal component analysis see eigensoft popgen readme
 
treemix 20 models the genetic drift at genomewide polymorphisms to infer relationships between populations it first estimates a dendrogram of the relationships between sampled populations next it compares the covariance structure modeled by this dendrogram to the observed covariance between populations when populations are more closely related than modeled by a bifurcating tree it suggests that there has been admixture in the history of those populations treemix then adds an edge to the phylogeny now making it a phylogenetic network the position and direction of these edges are informative if an edge originates more basally in the phylogenetic network it indicates that this admixture occurred earlier in time or from a more diverged population
 
treemix was used to create a maximum likelihood phylogeny of the one hundred and thirtyfour breeds because treemix was slow to add migration events modeled as edges to the complete data set of one hundred and thirtyfour breeds we also analyzed subsets of the data containing considerably fewer breeds for these subsets breeds with fewer than four samples were removed to speed up the analysis we iteratively used the previous graph with m1 migrations as the starting graph and added one migration edge for a total of m migrations we rooted the graphs with bali cattle used blocks of one thousand snps and used the se option to calculate standard errors of migration proportions migration edges were added until 998 of the variance in ancestry between populations was explained by the model we also ensured that the incorporated migration edges were statistically significant to further evaluate the consistency of migration edges we ran treemix five separate times with m set to seventeen point
 
admixture one point two one was used to evaluate ancestry proportions for k ancestral populations 21 we ran admixture with crossvalidation for values of k from one through twenty to examine patterns of ancestry and admixture in our data set map figure was generated in r using rworldmap 
 
the f3 and f4 statistics are used to detect correlations in allele frequencies that are not compatible with population evolution following a bifurcating tree these statistics provide support for admixture in the history of the tested populations 54 61 the threepop program from treemix was used to calculate f3 statistics 54 for all possible triplets from the one hundred and thirtyfour breeds the fourpop program of treemix was used to calculate f4 statistics for subsets of the breeds

lentiviral luciferase reporters of the per2 or bmal1 promoter were described previously 17 43 reporter cells and clonal lines were generated as previously described 23 briefly reporter viral particles of high titer 108 viral particlesml were obtained by ultracentrifugation and used to infect 3t3 3t3l1 and mmhd3 cells clonal cell lines of homogenous cell populations were obtained by single cell sorting and cloning in ninetysix well plates we then selected the clones that expressed high levels of luciferase and exhibited circadian properties comparable to infected parental cell populations these brighter cells were used in highthroughput assays on ninetysix well plates knockdown phenotypes were confirmed to be independent of the reporter either per2dluc or bmal1dluc and thus phenotypic differences across cell types are unlikely due to different reporter insertion sites
 
we used an optimized shrna design algorithm adapted from azablanc et al 72 for target sequence prediction this adapted algorithm selects for optimal target sequence for knockdown and against homologous sequences to minimize offtarget effects we selected six target sequences for each gene as listed in table s5 each shrna construct contained a sense and an antisense target sequence of nineteen nucleotides nts in length separated by nine nts for a hairpin loop and flanked by tttg at 5 and gatc at 3 ends for cohesive end cloning all oligos 55 nts were synthesized by integrated dna technologies idt the annealed oligonucleotides were first cloned into the bbsi and spei sites of a pgwlsi2u6 vector in which the shrna expression cassette is driven by an rna polymerase iii based mouse u6 promoter subsequently the u6shrna cassette was cloned into the lentiviral pll37gw vector modified from pll37 17 73 in a gateway lr clonase reaction life technologies according to manufacturers instructions
 
viral particles were prepared using standard methods in 293t cells on 12well plates as previously described 23 74 culture medium containing viral particles 106 viral particlesml were collected and used for subsequent infection of reporter cells transfection and infection efficiency were estimated by observing gfp coexpressed from a cmv promoter to produce high titer viruses crude viral particles were concentrated through ultracentrifugation and appropriate titers were used as described previously 74 this pipeline allowed us to generate a panel of shrna constructs against all known clock factors for genetic perturbation and phenotyping
 
we used a lumicycle luminometer version 231 actimetrics for bioluminescence recording of cells grown on thirtyfive mm culture dishes as described elsewhere 17 23 43 the lumicycle analysis program version two point five three actimetrics was used to determine circadian parameters briefly raw data were fitted to a linear baseline and the baselinesubtracted data were fitted to a sine wave damped from which period length and goodness of fit and damping constant were determined for samples that showed persistent rhythms goodnessoffit of 80 was usually achieved due to high transient luminescence upon medium change the first cycle was usually excluded from rhythm analysis damping rate  1damping constant for amplitude analysis raw data from day three to day five were fitted to a linear baseline and the baselinesubtracted polynomial number  1 data were fitted to a sine wave from which the amplitude was determined
 
we used a synergy two sl microplate reader bio tek for bioluminescence recording of cells grown on ninetysix well plates as previously described 23 synergy data were analyzed with the multicycle analysis program actimetrics in which bioluminescence data were baselinesubtracted and fit to a damped sine wave to determine period length goodness of fit and amplitude as with lumicycle analysis due to the various reporter expression levels and for direct comparison of different rhythms baseline subtracted data were plotted because there is no damping rate output function in the multicycle analysis we used a curve fitting program of cellularhythm to determine damping rate from synergy data as previously developed 75
 
for testing shrna knockdown efficiency targeting each clock gene the cdna was cloned into a p3xflagcmv14 vector flagtagged cdna was cotransfected with the indicated shrna in 3t3 or 293t cells forty eight hours posttransfection cells were lysed in ripa buffer containing complete protease roche and phosphatase inhibitors sigma protein expression was determined by western blot analysis using an antiflag monoclonal antibody sigma for all western assays pvdf membrane was used in protein transfer and supersignal west pico substrate thermo scientific was used for chemiluminescent detection

all studies were performed with ethical committee approval table s7 and subjects participated in the studies after providing informed consent
 
cases and controls came from thirtyfour studies forming part of the breast cancer association consortium bcac included in the cogs project 13 table s1 and glacier a study to investigate the genetics of lobular carcinoma in situ in europe mrec 06q170264 a uk caseonly study of lobular breast cancer bcac studies recruited all types of breast cancer pathological information in bcac was collected by the studies individually but combined and checked through standardized data control in a central database a total of 4152 ilc and eightynine lcis cases were identified by the central bcac pathology database see table s2 for number of cases by study
 
the glacier study recruited patients from participating centers throughout the uk with the aim of identifying predisposition genes for lcis andor ilc any patients aged sixty or less at the time of diagnosis with a current or past history of lcis with or without invasive disease of any histological subtype were eligible a total of 2539 cases were recruited 2167 were identified from local pathology reports in ninetyseven uk hospitals three hundred and fortysix cases were identified through the british breast cancer study bbcs using uk cancer registry data and twentysix cases from the royal marsden breast tissue bank cryptic relatedness analysis showed no evidence of overlap between these samples and the bcac samples all these cases were genotyped with the icogs chip and compared to 5000 uk controls selected from four uk studies participating in bcac and already typed on the icogs chip controls were randomly selected prior to analysis so that each of these uk studies including glacier had a casecontrol ratio of at least 12 table s8 these controls were excluded from casecontrol comparisons with bcac cases from the originating study this report includes only cases of pure lcis or ilc with or without lcis cases of lcis with idc or mixed lobular and ductal carcinoma in glacier were excluded in order to perform metaanalyses with the bcac studies which do not have information on the presence or absence of lcis associated with an invasive cancer after excluding individuals based on genotyping quality see genotyping and analysis and noneuropean ancestry data for the glacier study available for analyses included 1782 cases 1470 ilc with or without lcis three hundred and twelve pure lcis and 4755 controls
 
a further five hundred and sixteen cases 481 ilc thirtyfive lcis and 1465 controls were analyzed as part of phase ii controls were recruited through the glacier study but were not genotyped in phase i on the icogs chip to reduce costs and were all white west european cases came from the following studies two hundred and thirtytwo cases from glacier one hundred and seventysix from bbcs seventyone from dietcomplyf 38 thirtynine from kings health partners cancer biobank khpcb all cases were white west european apart from the thirtynine samples from the khpcb where there were no associated ethnicity data for studies that had also participated in phase i we selected samples so there was no overlap with the samples in phase i
 
after dna extraction from peripheral blood glacier samples were genotyped on the icogs custom illumina iselect which contains 211155 snps at kings college london the remaining cases and controls were genotyped as part of the cogs project described in detail elsewhere 13 the glacier cases were analyzed using the same qc criteria as the cogs project briefly genotypes were called using illuminas proprietary gencall algorithm and 10000 snps were manually inspected to verify the algorithm calling individuals were excluded if genotypically not female had overall call rate 95 or were ethnic outliers 248 cases as identified by multidimensional scaling combining the genotyping data with the three hapmap2 populations snps with a gencall rate of 025 call rate 95 call rate 99 if maf 01 and hwe107 or evidence of poor clustering on inspection of cluster plots were excluded all snps with maf 001 were excluded for this analysis a cryptic relatedness analysis of the whole dataset was performed using 46918 uncorrelated snps and there was no evidence of any duplicates
 
for glacier cases and controls principal component analysis pca was carried out on a subset of 46918 uncorrelated snps and used to exclude individuals or groups distinct from the main cluster using the first five principal components pcs figure s7 following removal of outliers 166 cases and two hundred and fortyfive controls the pca was repeated and the first five pcs included as covariates in the analysis the adequacy of the casecontrol matching was evaluated using quantilequantile plots of test statistics and the inflation factor  calculated using only uncorrelated snps that were not selected by bcac and were not within one of the four common finemapping regions to minimize selection for snps associated with breast cancer figure s1 as the majority of the snps on the icogs array were selected from gwas of breast ovarian and prostate cancer the snps selected for this analysis were taken from the set of snps selected by the prostate consortium with the assumption that these snps were more likely to be representative of common snps in terms of population structure in our study than those selected by the breast or ovarian consortia
 
for each snp we estimated a perallele logodds ratio or and standard error by logistic regression including the five pcs as covariates using plink v107 
 
genotyping and analysis of bcac studies is described in detail elsewhere 24 in brief data were analyzed using the genotype library and utilities glu package to estimate perallele ors and standard errors for each snp using unconditional logistic regression all analyses were performed in subjects of european ancestry determined by pc analyses and adjusted for study and seven principal components
 
casecontrol odds ratio or for ilc or lcis cases vs controls from bcac and glacier were combined using inverse varianceweighted fixedeffects metaanalysis as implemented in metal 39 caseonly analyses were also carried out to compare genotype frequencies for ilc vs lcis glacier and bcac and ilc vs idc bcac studies only and were used as a test for heterogeneity of ors by tumor subtype any study without data on both histological subtypes was dropped from the caseonly analysis
 
snps showing the strongest evidence for association with lobular tumors p5105 in the metaanalysis after excluding previously reported loci were genotyped at lgc genomics formerly kbiosciences in phase ii samples duplicate samples genotyped on the icogs chip were included to assess the concordance of the two genotyping methods cluster plots for rs11977670 are shown in figure s8
 
a pooled analysis of ilc including phase i glacier and bcac and phase ii data was performed data were analyzed using stata v12 to estimate perallele ors and standard errors for each snp using unconditional logistic regression differences in the strength of the associations with ilc idc and lcis were assessed using caseonly analyses a sign test was used to test whether the number of snps showing associations in the same direction in two different subtypes ie lcis vs ilc and idc vs ilc was significantly grater than expected by chance a likelihood ratio test was used as a global test of the null hypothesis of no differences between subtypes for any of the ors of the seventyfive known loci evaluated stratumspecific estimates of perallele or by categories of age and family history of disease were obtained from logistic regression models and differences in ors across strata were tested using an interaction term
 
in order to establish the snps functional role a window of ten kb both up and downstream was formed around the marker and pairwise r2 values calculated using one thousand genome ceu population data three snps were identified as being in ld r205 with rs11977670 and were compared to next generation sequence technologies to elucidate the overlap between chromatin states encode project two cell lines normal human mammary epithelial hmec and breast carcinoma mcf7 were used to establish these chromatin states ie active or engaged enhancers h3k27ac nucleosomedepleted regions dnase i and faire and rna polymerase linked regions pol ii expression data from the cancer genome atlas network for each gene within a one mb window of rs11977670 was analyzed looking for differential expression in each breast cancer subtype er ilc forty cases er idc three hundred and fortyone cases and ernegative idc one hundred and eight cases allele data for surrogate snp rs13225058 was obtained for all er cases from tcga these three hundred and thirtyfive cases were used to produce genotype specific gene expression data in r differences in gene expression between the three genotypes were tested for using onewayanova verified by ttest and visually by boxplot linear regression was performed across all three genotypes using copy number variation as a covariate level three copy number variation data hg19 build was obtained from the tcga data portal

this analysis uses data from the colon cancer family registry ccfr and the genetics and epidemiology of colorectal cancer consortium gecco text s1 and table s1 as described previously 14 37 all cases were defined as colorectal adenocarcinoma and confirmed by medical records pathologic reports or death certificate all studies received ethical approval by their respective institutional review boards and participants gave written informed consent
 
average sample and snp call rates and concordance rates for blinded duplicates have been previously published 37 in brief genotyped snps were excluded based on call rate 98 lack of hardyweinberg equilibrium in controls hwe p1104 and low minor allele frequency maf we imputed the autosomal snps of all studies to the ceu population in hapmap ii snps were restricted based on perstudy minor allele count 5 and imputation accuracy r203 to avoid missing any interactions after imputation and quality control qc analyses approximately 27m snps were used in the analysis
 
all analyses were restricted to individuals of european ancestry defined as samples clustering with the utah residents with northern and western european ancestry from the ceph collection ceu population in principal component analysis 38 including the hapmap ii populations as reference
 
information on basic demographics and environmental risk factors was collected by using inperson interviews andor structured questionnaires as detailed previously 3948 the multistep data harmonization procedure applied in this study is described in detail by hutter et al 14 here we focus on selected dietary variables for intake of red and processed meat fruits vegetables all measured in servings per day and fiber measured as gday these variables were coded as sex and studyspecific quartiles where the quartile groups were coded one to four of the quartile within the controls of each study and sex for studies that due to limited number of questions assessed dietary intake in categories rather than as continuous variables and had less than four intake categories we assigned these categories to the 2nd and 3rd or 1st to 3rd quartile as appropriate the lowest category of exposure was used as the reference and each dietary factor was analyzed as an ordinal variable eg 1 2 3 4 in the model data harmonization was performed using sas and tsql
 
statistical analyses of all samples were conducted centrally at the gecco coordinating center on individuallevel data to ensure a consistent analytical approach unless otherwise indicated we adjusted for age at the reference time sex when appropriate center when appropriate total energy consumption if available and the first three principal components from eigenstrat to account for potential population substructure the dietary variables were coded as described above each directly genotyped snp was coded as 0 1 or two copies of the variant allele for imputed snps we used the expected number of copies of the variant allele the dosage which has been shown to give unbiased test statistics 49 genotypes were treated as continuous variables ie logadditive effects each study was analyzed separately using logistic regression models and studyspecific results were combined using fixedeffects metaanalysis methods to obtain summary odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis across studies we calculated the heterogeneity pvalues by woolfs test 50 quantilequantile qq plots were assessed to determine whether the distribution of the pvalues was consistent with the null distribution except for the extreme tail
 
to test for interactions between snps and dietary risk factors we conduct two primary analyses 1 conventional casecontrol logistic regression analysis including a multiplicative interaction term 2our newly developed cocktail method 15 for the conventional logistic regression analysis we modeled the snp by environment gxe interaction by the product of the snp and the dietary variable which is in this study the e adjusting for age sex study site energy principal components and the main effects of the snp and dietary variable adjustment for additional variables smoking alcohol bmi and other dietary variables did not appreciably change the results a twosided pvalue of 5108 for a snpdiet factor interaction was considered statistically significant yielding a genomewide significance level zero point zero five assuming about one million independent tests across the genome 0051000000  5108 5156
 
motivated by recent advances in methods development for detecting gxe interaction 17 5760 our second approach was based on our recently developed cocktail method this statistical method combines the most appealing aspect of several newly developed gxe methods with the goal of creating a comprehensive and powerful test for genomewide detection of gxe 15 in brief this method consists of twosteps a screening step to prioritize snps and a testing step for gxe interaction specifically for the screening step we ranked and prioritized variants through a genomewide screen of each of the 27m snps referred to as g by the maximum of the test statistics from marginal association of gs on disease risk 58 and correlation between g and environmentaldietary variable e in cases and controls combined 59 a combination which allows for identifying variants with different interaction patterns
 
based on the ranks of these snps from screening we used a weighted hypothesis framework to partition snps into groups with higher ranked groups having less stringent alphalevel cutoffs for interaction 60 61 we followed the grouping scheme used by ionita et al 61 such that for example the first three groups consist of five snps snp one to 5 ten snps snp six to 15 and twenty snps snp sixteen to 36 and the corresponding cutoffs are group one  25  0005 group two  410  zero point zero zero one two five and group three  820  00003 respectively so on and so forth to maintain the overall genomewide alpha level of 005 to avoid testing correlated snps we pruned snps based on proximity exclude any snp within 50 kb of the selected snp given that ld pruning is difficult to implement for large number of snps while the choice of the group size is arbitrary our simulation study showed that different group size did not impact the results substantially and importantly we chose the group size before looking at the results
 
the second step of the cocktail method is the testing step we tested each of the gs for gxe interactions using the caseonly co logistic regression test the use of the co test is justified because we did not observe correlation between g and any of the tested dietary factors and it has been shown that under the independence assumption the co test provides substantial efficiency gain over the conventional cc test 62 since the co is not independent of the correlation screening a requirement to avoid inflation of type i error rates 63 we used co test only when the maximum screening test statistic came from the marginal association and the casecontrol test otherwise
 
in text s2 we describe two secondary statistical gxe methods that we used to explore other novel gxe methods the 2step method by gauderman et al method 16 and a two degree of freedom joint test for marginal associations of g and gxe interaction by dai et al 17 all analyses were conducted using the r programming language 64

ten to twenty ml of peripheral white blood cells were harvested by venipuncture from individuals from family fny01 and mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on histopaque sigmaaldrich according to the manufacturers instructions the purified cells were frozen in two million cell aliquots two million mononuclear cells were expanded and differentiated into basophilic erythroblasts in culture for two weeks in serumfree stemspan media stem cells technologies va ca containing the cytokine cocktail mix described by olivier et al 37 at the end of the culture cells were immunophenotyped by facs using antibodies against cd71 and cd235a cells were relatively uniform in size and more than 97 of the cells were doublepositives demonstrating that the vast majority of cells in the culture were erythroid and at the basophilic stage of differentiation
 
twenty to fifty million exponentially growing basophilic erythroblasts were harvested on day fourteen of culture washed with ice cold pbs fixed by dropwise addition of icecold 75 ethanol and stored at 4c before processing fixed cells were treated with rnase a 05 mgml for sixty minutes sigmaaldrich and stained for dna content with propidium iodide 50 gml invitrogen carlsbad ca cells in the s phase of the cell cycle were sorted using a facs aria ii bd biosciences genomic dna was prepared using the wizard genomic dna purification kit promega and quantified using nanodrop and picogreen methods quantit picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen
 
sequencing of family fny01 to obtain the phased genomes was performed with dna from peripheral blood white blood cells 36 since more than 995 of peripheral blood white blood cells are in the g1 phase of the cell cycle figure 1b data from these experiments were used as the g1 control in all the timexseq experiments described in this report
 
genomic dna was sheared to 300600 bp size using a focused ultrasonicator from covaris woburn ma size purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed on a dna chip using a two thousand one hundred bioanalyzer agilent technologies inc to verify size distribution dna was endrepaired endit kit epicenter biotechnologies an aoverhang was added klenow 3 to 5 exo minus neb and ligated to illumina pairend adapter sequences illumina the ligated libraries were size selected 60050 bp pcr amplified for ten cycles and purified with spri beads agencourt ampure xp fisher scientific pairend library quality was verified on a bioanalyzer as described above each library was sequenced on three lanes on the illumina hiseq two thousand yielding about 109 one hundred bp pairend reads corresponding to about 30 coverage for each s phase library
 
after library sequencing the reads were aligned to hg nineteen with bwa 69 using the default parameters and the snps were called using the gatk variant caller in the knownallele mode 70 providing the vcf file that describes the genomes of family fny01 36 as a reference file in this mode the gatk calls only the snps at the positions specified in the userprovided reference vcf file
 
once the snps had been called the vcf files for the s phase libraries was phased using the vcf for family fny01 as a reference and specific functions in genplay multigenome 71 once the files were phased files in the bed format containing the allele depth for the paternal and maternal chromosomes were generated again using specific functions that are provided in genplay
 
the read depth files were binned in to five hundred bp windows normalized to the total number of reads containing a snp in each track and smoothed using the genplay gaussian filter sigma  one hundred kb sg1 ratios for the paternal and maternal chromosomes were then calculated the resulting numbers were multiplied by a factor one point four to take into account the fact that the average copy number in s is higher than in g1 these resulted in timex profiles with value ranging between zero point nine and 21 no other filter or normalization was applied to the data masks were created to eliminate the regions of low snpdensity using genplay island finder functions the resulting masks were applied in selected analysis to ascertain that the results were independent of snp density other smoothing techniques loess moving average yielded essentially the same results
 
the combined fny013233 allelespecific replication profiles were produced by generating four new files a combined g1 maternal file containing the sum of the alleledepths of the maternal homologs of fny0132 and 32 a combined g1 paternal file containing the sum of the allele depths of the paternal homologs of fny0132 and 32 and similarly two combined maternal and paternal s files these four files were then processed as above to generate combined maternal and paternal sg1 profiles
 
asynchronously replicated regions were detected with the genplay island finder on a data file generated by subtracting the paternal sg1 simulated profiles from the maternal sg1 simulated profiles
 
the genplay island finder function is based on the sicer algorithm of zang et al 72 and identifies broad regions of enriched read counts rather than peaks the algorithm allows for gaps in the island and is well suited for the allelespecific timex data because of the heterogeneous distribution of the snps in the human genome implementation of the algorithm in genplay is described in the genplay documentation in the genplay web site
 
a timex difference threshold of 002 a maximum gap sizes of 250000 and a minimum island size of 50000 bp were used in the island finder statistically significant regions were then identified using a quisquare test for goodness of fit chisqtest function in r on 22 contingency tables built by calculating the total number of reads obtained in the s and g1 fraction of the maternal and paternal chromosomes for each islands qvalues were then calculated using the padjust function in r with the fdr parameter to control for multiple testing an fdr rate of 5 was used to define the statistically significant asynchronous replication domains the parameters for the island finder were determined by optimizing by trial and error the rate of discovery of simulated regions see below
 
core detection core were detected as ard except that a timex difference threshold of 01 a maximum gap sizes of 50000 and a minimum island size of 50000 bp were used in the genplay island finder statistical significance was determined as above
 
simulated maternal and paternal pairs of s and g1 resampled control profiles were generated by imputing in a random number generator based on the binomial function similar to the rbinom function in r the number of s reads and the total number of reads sg1 reads observed for each informative snp in the maternal track of fny0132
 
about 1000 randomly located simulated asynchronous genomic regions ranging in size from 125000 to 2000000 bp were then introduced in the simulated maternal control s profiles by increasing by a fixed percentage 5 10 15 20 thirty or 50 the total sg1 number of reads observed for each snp and by assigning the extra reads to the s phase profile these s and sg1 read numbers were then imputed in the random generator to generate resampled read numbers in these simulated asynchronous regions
 
once simulated number of reads for the s and g1 profiles of the maternal and paternal homologs had been generated simulated sg1 timex profiles were generated as described above using gaussian smoothing sigma  one hundred kb bedgraph files were generated to visualize the simulation in genplay
 
asynchronously replicated regions in these simulated profiles were then detected with genplay island finder as described above simulations were repeated multiple times
 
a java script implementing this algorithm can be found at 
 
s and g1 aligned reads obtained after alignment to hg19 were loaded into one kb bins in genplay normalized to the total number of reads s to g1 ratios were calculated outliers were eliminated sg124 and the profiles were smoothed with the genplay gaussian filter sigma  twenty kb use of other smoothing techniques loess moving average yielded essentially the same results for more convenient analysis values were then indexed between one and two point
 
nascent newly replicated dna strands from cultured basophilic erythroblasts were isolated following two protocols first we have isolated rnaprimed short newly replicated dna following the procedure described in martin et al 23 briefly dna was extracted from asynchronous cultures denatured and fractionated by centrifugation on a neutral sucrose gradient dna fractions within the zero point five kb to one kb size range were collected and dna was exposed to lambda exonuclease to remove nonrnaprimed genomic dna fragments purified rnaprimed ns were randomprimed and the resulting doublestranded nascent dna 1 g was sequenced using the illumina solexa genome analyzer ii
 
second to control for possible lambda exonuclease biases we have also isolated and sequenced short nascent dna strands that were isolated based on incorporation of the nucleotide analog brdu as described by aladjem et al 40 briefly we labeled cells with a 30minute pulse of brdu lysed the cells and fractionated small dna strands 1 kb using a neutral sucrose gradient we then employed immuneprecipitation with antibrdu antibodies to isolate newly replicated dna strands on the basis of selective incorporation of brdu the resulting ns were subject to massively parallel sequencing for both methods sheared genomic dna was sequenced as a standard to control for mapability and other potential biases
 
nascent libraries were prepared and sequenced on two lanes of an illumina gii analyzer read length was thirtysix bp reads were aligned to hg19 using bwa and loaded in genplay in bins of one hundred bp three kb or twenty kb depending on the analysis peaks were called using macs one point four two using the default parameters or the genplay island finder
 
the ratios of the timex values of the two chromosome homologs for individuals fny01 32 and 33 were calculated in five kb windows and averaged over five hundred kb intervals overlapping every one hundred kb ratios smaller than one were inverted since we expected the svs to either increase or decrease the timing ratios svs present in the family are described in detail in 36
 
similar results were obtained with interval of one mb with nonoverlapping intervals of zero point five or one mb or by averaging the distance or the absolute values of the differences between the sg1 ratios of the homologs rather than their ratios
 
hires timex profiles of fny01 32 and 33 were averaged and binned at three kb ns were binned at two hundred bp and smoothed with the genplay gaussian filter using sigma three kb or twenty kb the tracks were then converted to three kb bins after saturating the outliers ie all bins with scores larger than x with x  mean plus three times the standard deviation were set to a score equal to x the averaged timex profiles were then divided into five equal fractions termed s1 to s5 based on the timex values with s1 replicating the earliest and s5 the latest correlation and linear regression were performed in r or in statgraphics centurion xvii statpoint technologies incorporated removing the outliers rather than saturating them yielded similar results
 
peaks were called using macs v142 using the default value p10e5 and fdr02 sheared genomic dna from the same individual was used as the control
 
the number of peaks observed with the brdu and lambda exonuclease methods was similar respectively 250000 and 25000 the average widths of the peaks were also similar about 100400 bp in both cases to facilitate the comparison between the methods all peaks were normalized to a width of four hundred bp which resulted in a 50 reduction in peak number and the analysis was performed on the top 100000 peaks only
 
peaks were considered to be associated to a genomic features if they overlapping by one base pair or more with a cpg island a transcription start site defined as one kb fragment centered on the start site or with four hundred bp fragments centered around a gquadruplexes or a dnase i hypersensitive site
 
gc content was calculated as the average percent of c and g in one hundred kb windows in ten kb intervals
 
because of the very uneven baseline macs or the genplay island finders were not able to satisfactorily detect and call the ripples within the larger timex domains that are illustrated in figure four point to call these peaks we therefore devised a specific strategy illustrated in figure s5 briefly the timex profiles were smoothed with the gaussian filters and a sigma at twenty kb which revealed the ripples and at one hundred kb which smooth out these ripples and the one hundred kb smooth was subtracted from the twenty kb smooth the top ten percent of the peaks thus obtained were then analyzed since they coincided closely with the major ripples that we wished to characterize the same strategy was used to define the clusters of ns

since the large majority of l1s are truncated at the 5 end 86 the copy number of 3 ends better represents the history of retrotransposition events therefore we used five hundred and seventyfive bp in the 3 end of l1 orf2 as reconstructed below to get a comprehensive view of l1 retrotransposition using the megabat l1 lineage one 50 consensus as the query sequence we ran censor four point two 87 against the 2 genome trace files of p vampyrus baylor college of medicine ftpncbinlmnihgovpubtracedbpteropusvampyrus to find detectable sequences with 60 identity and 90 coverage of the query using two thousand random sequences from the censor run subfamilies were identified based on shared sequence variants cosegregating mutations with coseg 021  55 following the default parameters nine subfamilies were generated and their consensuses used as query sequences for a second round of censor against the p vampyrus genome all identified l1 sequences from the second censor run were used for a second round of coseg which required the additional parameter of at least two hundred and fifty sequences to form a subfamily consensuses of the sixtyfour subfamilies thus generated were used as query sequences to run censor for a third time each hits percent identity to the corresponding query was used to assign it to a l1 subfamily and the copy numbers in each subfamily were counted seven subfamilies containing less than two hundred and fifty sequences were removed consensuses from each of the remaining fiftyseven subfamilies were used as query sequences to run censor for a fourth time and all detected l1s were assigned to their subfamilies by the percent identity of each hit to its query the fiftyseven subfamily consensuses were aligned with ancestral mammalian l1s from repbase 56 57 reconstructed by smit et al 58 and wade et al 59 with the lasergene software suite dnastar madison wi and a distance matrix was calculated based on the alignment a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using phyml 88 with the gtrig model and one hundred bootstrap replicates figure s1 l1s were then assigned to families based on a 35 withinfamily pairwise distance from their subfamily consensuses sequence specificity of l1 families was determined by blast 89 against the ncbi whole genome sequencing databases the consensus sequences of subfamilies 1 5 7 3 40 36 34 zero and twentynine were used as the blast queries representing families 1a 1b 1c 2a 2b 2c 2d three and 4 respectively a subfamily and its corresponding family were considered batspecific only if 5 of the top one hundred blast hits were not from bats

a fulllength consensus sequence of the most recently active l1 from megabat lineage one was reconstructed by a series of progressive steps the seed for the reconstruction was a conserved five hundred and seventyfive bp region in the 3 half of orf2 figure 3a this region was previously amplified by degenerate pcr and a consensus sequence was determined 91 walks were performed in the 5 and 3 directions away from the cloned region and continued in both directions until fulllength l1s were reconstructed to aid with the reconstruction a software pipeline was developed consisting of perl  ruby  and bash  scripts the pipeline queried filtered and extracted data from the genome of p vampyrus an individual step resulted in the addition of 100500 bp of sequence to the consensus depending on the quality of the alignment at the ends which was then used in the next step of the walk and in the final l1 reconstruction candidate sequences were identified in the database using blast with default parameters and an evalue of 11050 parsed through the bioperl searchio module  and screened based on their similarity to the input sequence only hits with at least 92 identity were retained to assure that the reconstruction did not include older lineages and then a ruby script extracted those sequences with overhangs of at least one hundred bp alignments for each end were created and handedited to yield consensuses of clean read which were aligned into a master alignment a 300500 bp region from each end was selected to act as the seeds for the next step in the walk the process was repeated until the entire element was reconstructed upon completion of the fulllength l1 a five hundred bp seed was chosen arbitrarily from the final consensus and the pipeline was run again to verify the reconstruction methylated cpg sites evolve rapidly and must be corrected in the final consensus cpg sites were identified by their high variation and the presence of dinucleotide sequence cg ca tg or ta these were examined manually edited and designated as cg in the final consensus this pipeline also reconstructed the most recently active l1 lineage of four additional species listed in table s1 but required higher percent identities for the walks to reduce the noise introduced by older lineages
 
to compare the reconstruction of the extinct l1 to other l1s sequences from a range of mammalian species were either reconstructed as described above or selected from the repbase report of february two thousand and thirteen 56 l1 consensuses of all species available in repbase were aligned except those of dolphin and american opossum which had problematic regions of nonhomology when multiple l1 consensus sequences for the same species were present in repbase the one with highest average percent identity to its genomic sequence was chosen to represent the most recent master l1 in the genome some of the repbase l1 sequences were out of frame at regions containing adenosine runs or contained inframe stop codons both resulting in significantly shorter orfs the following corrections brought these sequences into the correct reading frame l11cpo ignored an inframe stop codon at bp 30503052 and used the original sequence for the alignment l11dv added a n after bp 6015 and l1amim deleted an a at bp 15901591 and bp 53365337

each study performed single marker association tests and studyspecific linear regression models which used zscores of logtransformed cortisol additive snp effects and were adjusted for age and sex model 1 age sex and smoking model 2 or age sex smoking and body mass index model 3 imputation of the genechip results used the hapmap ceu population build thirtysix point in cohorts with consanguineous populations orcades and croatia adjustments for principal components in kinship matrices were performed using probabel for other cohorts identitybydescent coefficients were calculated using plink and related participants excluded in the majority of cohorts participants were only included if blood samples had been obtained within a sixty minute time interval when variations in time of sampling were ignored in a subset of cohorts samples were obtained over a wider time interval but always in the morning before one thousand one hundred h and time of blood sampling recorded for these cohorts three further models were run as above but also including time of sampling calculated as minutes from first sampling time as an additional covariate 43
 
quality control was carried out on the imputed genomewide data for all eleven studies prior to metaanalysis this excluded all samples with a minor allele frequency maf 2 call rate 95 hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe1108 and poor imputation quality mach r2hat030 impute properinfo060 beagle info030 as appropriate quantilequantile qq plots and genomic control lambda were used to confirm quality control sex chromosomes were not analysed
 
we performed fixed effects metaanalysis which used combined allelic effects weighted by the inverse of their variance for each of the models using the gwama program 44 this aligned all studies to the same reference allele at each snp thus avoiding strand errors and excluded snps with obvious input errors eg discrepancies in effect allele frequencies the results from analysis with or without genomic control were nearly identical as expected with gc  1005 the genomewide significance threshold for the metaanalysis was p5108 percentage variation of cortisol was calculated from metaanalysis results as 2effect allele frequency1effect allele frequencybeta2sd2 a regional plot was generated using locuszoom 45 and heat map using snpplotter 46 in r version 2152 joint analysis of metaanalysis was performed with the gcta program 47
 
to detect independent top snps on the basis of empirical estimates of linkage disequilibrium between the snps we used the clumping function as implemented in plink 20 all the snps with a pvalue5105 in metaanalysis were used for clumping we grouped the snps within five hundred kb of the index snp that have r2 02 with the index snp
 
genes identified in the metaanalysis were evaluated in the raine study mrossweden and edinburgh type two diabetes study et2ds raine study and mrossweden had gwas data so we extracted the replication snp results and et2ds was genotyped at the wellcome trust clinical research facility genetics core laboratory in edinburgh using the openarray genotyping platform rs2749527 failed manufacture for the openarray and was replaced with rs2749529 r2  0905 d  10 in all replication cohorts genotypic association analysis in these studies followed the same methods as those described above for the discovery metaanalysis adjusting for age and sex
 
we performed metaanalyses of sexspecific gwas and conditional gwas in a subset of populations using single marker association tests of zscores of logtransformed cortisol for the sexspecific analysis each study adjusted for age in both men n  3546 and women n  5956 for the conditional analysis each study adjusted for age sex and each of the serpina6 loci snps rs12589136 n  9308 rs11621961 n  7687 and rs2749527 n  9307 individually we then did fixed effects metaanalysis using gwama program
 
we used the versatile genebased association study vegas program 22 to perform genecentric analysis this used individual snp pvalues derived from the metaanalysis results to compute a genebased pvalue we used two methods all snps within a gene or a subset of the 10 most significant snps in each gene boundary vegas accounted for linkage disequilibrium between snps using the hapmap phase two population ceu snps were assigned to 18000 genes based on positions in build thirtysix hg18 with gene boundaries of 50 kb of the utr bonferroni corrected threshold for genewide significance was 3106 the overlap of snps included in the gene boundaries in our results indicates this is likely to be an overly conservative correction factor 22
 
a list of sixtyone candidate genes with known biological function in the regulation of cortisol was compiled by a panel of experts in the field all snps within and 50 kb of these genes were examined in the gwama results and genebased p values were inspected in vegas results
 
genotypes for the serpina6serpina1 gene region chr149477058594857029 build 37 in the croatiakorcula samples n  898 were extracted from an illumina exome chip v1 analysis genotypes were called in genomestudio illumina using the charge consortium joint calling cluster file  48 one thousand genomes imputation was performed using genotypes from illumina humanhap370cnv after quality control individual call rate 97 snp call rate 98 maf 001 hwe 1106 prephasing was performed using shapeit v2 49 and imputation using impute2 50 and the all phase one integrated release v3 april 2012 reference panel associations with plasma cortisol were analysed in genabel 51
 
more detailed phenotyping was undertaken in samples from three hundred and sixteen participants in the croatiakorcula cohort comprising one hundred and fiftyeight age and sexmatched homozygotes at the top hit variant rs12589136 53 tt one hundred and six gg however one tt sample had insufficient sample for cbg measurement resulting in fiftytwo tt and one hundred and six gg an additional one hundred and sixty randomly selected samples had cbg measured however two samples failed genotyping resulting in an additional fortyseven tg and one hundred and eleven gg
 
total plasma cortisol was measured with a commercial radioimmunoassay mp biomedicals uk total cbg was also measured in croatiakorcula samples using a commercial radioimmunoassay diasource louvainlaneuve belgium total cortisol binding capacity was measured using a ligandsaturation assay with 3hcortisol perkinelmer life sciences waltham ma as the labelled ligand and dextrancoated charcoal to separate the cbgbound 3hcortisol as previously described 52 1antitrypsin was measured with a commercial elisa genway biotech san diego usa unbound free plasma cortisol was calculated from measured total plasma cortisol and total cbg values using coolens equation 53 free cortisol was also measured by elisa following equilibrium dialysis briefly dialysis tubing 1214 kd medicell london uk was heated to 80c for thirty min in 2 na bicarbonate and one mm edta before overnight dialysis of plasma into phosphate buffered saline containing 1 gelatin at 37c and measurement of dialysed free cortisol by commercial elisa salimetrics europe ltd newmarket uk cbg were also measured as previously described 23 by elisas using monoclonal antibodies 12g2 and 9g12 antibody 9g12 binds to an epitope in the reactive centre loop rcl the elastase cleavage site on cbg and has been used to infer intact uncleaved cbg whereas antibody 12g2 binds to a distant epitope and measures total cleaved and uncleaved cbg
 
as croatiakorcula is a population isolate we used the polygenic and mmscore functions in genabel 51 all regression equations included the first three principal components and kinship matrix derived from gwas data in this population and used zscores of the traits all variables were normalised using log transformation cortisol calculated free cortisol measured free cortisol cbg 1antitrypsin and reported means are geometric means the ratio of intactcleaved was normally distributed

the initial dataset consisted of 6778 ischaemic stroke cases of european ancestry and 12095 ancestrymatched controls from the wellcome trust casecontrol consortium ii project in ischaemic stroke 1 as well as a cohort from milan italy 16 these included 2858 cases and 5716 matched controls genotyped using the immunochip platform and 3940 cases genotyped using either the illumina six hundred and ten k or six hundred and sixty k platforms matched with 6379 controls genotyped on the illumina human 12m duo uk illumina human five hundred and fifty k german and illumina six hundred and ten k platforms italian table 1 the immunochip cases were described in the previous wtccc2 ischaemic study where they formed the replication effort 1 as well as in a recent paper 37 genotyping of the five immunochip case cohorts on the commercially available immunochip array illumina san diego ca usa was performed at the sanger centre hinxton cambridge uk swedish controls were provided and genotyped by the swedish sle network uppsala sweden belgian control samples were provided through the efforts of the international multiple sclerosis genetics consortium imsgc german controls were derived from the popgen biobank 38 uk controls were derived from the one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight birth cohort any of the one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight birth controls overlapping with those from the wtccc2 datasets as assessed by ibd estimates were removed prior to analysis standard quality control procedures were undertaken on all centres before centrewise imputation to the one thousand genomes phase one integrated variant set march 2012 using impute v220 39 40 snps with poor imputation quality info03 or low minor allele frequency maf001 were discarded
 
ischemic stroke was defined as a typical clinical syndrome with radiological confirmation ascertained cases were classified into individual stroke subtypes using the trial of org ten thousand one hundred and seventytwo in acute stroke toast criteria in all centres 41 ageatonset was defined as age at first hospital admission for stroke where this information was unavailable age at blood draw was used 73 of cases the ageatonset and gender distributions of the populations are given in table s3 ageatonset quantiles were calculated from all the cases from the discovery datasets in the four stroke phenotypes all is and the three stroke subtypes ce laa svd and these were used to evaluate associated loci at different ageatonset thresholds
 
the prevalence of ischaemic stroke by age was obtained from a recent publication 9 genderspecific estimates were averaged and prevalences within each of the stroke subtypes were assumed to be approximately 20 of the overall total similar to proportions seen in populationbased studies 42 we modeled phenotype data using a continuous unobserved quantitative trait called the disease liability which we used to approximate the effect of ageatonset on the liability scale based on estimates of ischaemic stroke prevalence by age from epidemiological data full details in text s2 we developed two models for our analysis one based on the prevalence rates for all ischaemic stroke cases and secondly for the three stroke subtypes we used these models to calculate posterior mean liabilities after conditioning on ageatonset for the four stroke phenotypes separately controls were modeled in the same way but were assumed to take the posterior mean from the lower unaffected portion of the distribution in the liability threshold model where age data was missing individuals were assigned the median age value full descriptions of the models used and the formulae used to calculate posterior mean liabilities are given in text s2 regression was then performed on posterior liabilities by multiplying the number of samples by the squared correlation between the expected genotype dosage and posterior mean liabilities for each of the discovery cohorts in the four ischaemic stroke phenotypes ce laa svd is following a previous approach 17 ancestryinformative principal components were included where appropriate 6 of eight centres using the eigenstrat procedure 43 all analysis was performed using the r statistical software
 
the results from each centre were metaanalysed for each of the four phenotypes using stouffers zscore weighted approach as implemented in metal 44 genomic control was used to correct for any residual inflation due to population stratification 45 betweenstudy heterogeneity was assessed using cochrans q statistic we considered only snps present in at least 75 of the cases and with no evidence of heterogeneity cochrans q pvalue0001 all snps analysed were either genotyped or imputed in both the immunochip and the genomewide datasets after metaanalysis the resulting pvalues were compared with the equivalent values from an unconditioned analysis for snps more significant in the ageatonset informed analysis and with p5106 we determined the evidence of a true ageatonset effect by generating one thousand permutations of ageatonset and rerunning the ageatonset informed analysis metaanalysing as previously we calculated an empirical pvalue by dividing the number of permuted observations showing greater significance in the metaanalysis than the observed results by the number of permutations any novel snp with a metaanalysis p5106 and evidence of an ageatonset effect at p005 were taken forward for replication we set the experimentwide significance threshold at p5108
 
replication of an associated variant was performed in a further ten cohorts from metastroke nine of the centres used a crosssectional design while one was a large prospective population based cohort aric nine of the centres were of european ancestry while one consisted of individuals of pakistani ancestry race table 2 all centres used a casecontrol methodology centres with a cross sectional design used logistic regression to model the association of genotype dosages from imputation with the dichotomous outcome of ischaemic stroke and prospective cohorts used cox proportionalhazards models to evaluate time to first stroke fitting an additive model relating genotype dose to the stroke outcome european ancestry replication centres were metaanalysed using a fixed effects inversevariance weighted method to assess the evidence for association of the snp for replication samples of all ancestries we performed a transethnic metaanalysis using a randomeffects model to control for any resulting heterogeneity 18 to evaluate the overall evidence for association the results of the discovery and replication analyses were combined using fishers method
 
expression of the two genes proximal to the associated variant was tested in atherosclerotic plaques from the tampere vascular study 27 46 47 48 49 carotid femoral and aortic atherosclerotic plaques constituting the intima and inner media were prospectively obtained between two thousand and five and two thousand and nine from patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria 1 carotid endarterectomy attributable to asymptomatic or symptomatic 70 carotid stenosis or 2 femoral or 3 aortic endarterectomy with aortoiliac or aortobifemoral bypass attributable to symptomatic peripheral arterial disease whole thickness left internal thoracic artery samples obtained during coronary artery bypass surgery and identified as being microscopically atherosclerosis free were used as controls the patients were consecutively recruited and stratified according to indication for surgery all open vascular surgical procedures were performed at the division of vascular surgery and heart center tampere university hospital
 
fresh tissue samples were immediately soaked in rnalater solution ambion inc and homogenized using an ultraturrax t80 homogenizer ika rna was extracted with the trizol reagent invitrogen and mirneasy minikit qiagen with the rnasefree dnase set qiagen according to manufacturer instructions the rna isolation protocol was validated by analyzing the integrity of the rna with the rna six thousand nano chip kit agilent the expression levels were analyzed with an illumina humanht12 v3 expression beadchip illumina in brief 300500 ng of rna was reverse transcribed in crna and biotinutp labeled using the illuminatotalprep rna amplification kit ambion and one thousand five hundred ng of crna was then hybridized to the illumina humanht12 v3 expression beadchip
 
the beadchips were scanned with the illumina iscan system after background subtraction raw intensity data were exported using the illumina genome studio software further data processing was conducted by means of r language and appropriate bioconductor modules data were log2transformed and robust multichip average and robust spline normalization rmarsn were used accuracy of the expression array was validated with qrtpcr 50 mrna expression levels in the tissues were determined a fold change statistic was estimated between the two tissues and significance was calculated using a t test
 
recent evidence indicates that a significant proportion of gwas snps fall within regions that are likely to affect binding of nearby proteins such as transcription factor binding sites 51 52 we used the regulomedb database to access regulatory information from encode and other existing publications 19 investigating the evidence that the snps in the associated locus have a regulatory function first the linkagedisequilibrium ld patterns amongst the most strongly associated snps were determined we then used plink to determine the ld structure of the associated region using ldpatterns from the eightyfive utah residents from the one thousand genomes project 53 54 all snps with r206 were identified within a 2000 kb window from the index snp all of the snps identified were then investigated using regulomedb to determine the evidence that any of the snps have a regulatory function
 
permutation analysis was performed to evaluate the ageatonset informed approach to show that including age at onset information directly led to the increased significance due solely to inclusion of ageatonset information at tested snps first we identified a set of snps enriched for true association in the case control analysis of ischaemic stroke and subtypes an expanded set of discovery and metastroke studies were analysed using standard case control methods and subsequent metaanalysis see table s2 snps with p005 and no evidence of heterogeneity p00001 were extracted and pruned for ld 300 kb window r2025 leaving a set of almost independent snps for further analysis each retained snp represented the most significant association in each ld block as determined by the clump procedure in plink based on ld patterns from the ceu individuals from one thousand genomes the number of snps used in each analysis is given in table s5 these snp subsets were derived for ischaemic stroke and for each stroke subset and then used in the ageatonset informed analysis analysis was performed as previously for each stroke subtype using the ageatonset informed method within studies and metaanalysis across studies giving observed results as obtained above we then performed a permutation study to obtain the expected distribution of pvalues at these snps age at onset for cases was permuted within stroke subtypes within each study and then the data were reanalysed for one thousand permutations two summary statistics were constructed 1 within permutations we compared pvalues from analysis of permuted age at onset with pvalues from the observed data and tabulated the proportion of snps with increased significance in the observed data set than in the permuted data set across permutations we calculated the median proportion of snps with increased significance in the observed data 2 within permutations we converted each snp pvalue to a z score and summed the absolute value of the z score across snps sumz an empirical pvalue for the ageinformed analysis was calculated from the proportion of simulated data sets where sumz exceeded the value in the observed analysis this analysis was performed at snp subsets defined from four snp pvalue thresholds in the discovery and metastroke studies p005 p0005 p00005 and p000005
 
finally we assessed the evidence of an ageatonset effect at the four stroke loci identified in the metastroke ischaemic stroke collaboration 9p21 hdac9 pitx2 zfhx3 16 for each snp we generated an empirical pvalue from the proportion of permutations showing stronger association than in the observed ageatonset informed analysis

for stage one and two gwas studies genotyping was performed with affymetrix or illumina genomewide snp arrays imputation of missing genotypes was performed using mach 49 impute2 50 or beagle 51 using hapmap reference haplotypes for each study samples reflecting duplicates low call rate gender mismatch or population outliers were excluded in general snps were excluded by the following criteria call rate 095 minor allele frequency maf001 minor allele count 10 hardyweinberg pvalue 1104 or imputation quality score 05 table s3 for de novo replication studies genotyping was performed using the sequenom massarray platform sequenom san diego ca sample and snp quality controls were performed as with gwas data
 
single snp association was performed for each study by regressing t2d casecontrol status on genotypes to account for uncertainty of genotype calls during imputation genotype probabilities or dosage were used for association tests in imputed snps the association tests assumed an additive genetic model and adjusted for age sex study centers and principal components principal components were included to control for confounding effects of admixture proportion and population structure secondary analysis with additional adjustment for bmi was performed for snps with p1105 in stage one metaanalysis and index snps previously reported to be associated with t2d or glucose homeostasis traits bmi adjustment allows increasing power to detect t2d loci independent of bmi effect and diminish associations at t2d loci with effects modulated through bmi logistic regression was used for samples of unrelated individuals generalized estimating equations 52 or solar 53 were used for samples of related individuals association results with extreme values absolute beta coefficient or standard error 10 primarily due to low cell counts resulting from small sample sizes andor low minor allele frequencies were excluded table s3
 
in stage 1 association results were combined by a fixed effect model with inverse variance weighted method using the metal software 12 genomic control correction 11 was applied to each study before metaanalysis and to the overall results after metaanalysis results from snps genotyped in 10000 samples and those with allele frequency difference 03 among studies were excluded a total of 2579389 snps were analyzed in the metaanalysis table s3 in stage 2a association results from african american replication studies were also combined using a fixed effect inverse variance weighted method to assess the overall effects in african americans stage 12a and both african americans and europeans stage 12a2b association results from studies in the respective stages were combined using a fixed effect inverse variance weighted method genomewide significance is declared at p5108 from the metaanalysis result of all stages which has better power than the replicationbased strategy 54
 
among the fiftyone snps carried forward for replication heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies within each stage was assessed using cochrans q statistic implemented in metal metaanalysis results from stages one and 2a stage 12a and 2b were used to assess heterogeneity of effect sizes between discovery and replication stages in african americans and between african americans and europeans respectively for snps with significant heterogeneous effect size after multiple comparison corrections p het0001 metaanalysis results including studies of all stages assessed by the random effect model implemented in gwama 55 were reported heterogeneous associations may partly due to differences in ascertainment scheme across studies for index snps reported in prior studies assessment of heterogeneity using cochrans q statistic between prior studies and this study were also reported
 
index snps associated with t2d or glucose homeostasis traits from prior gwas and candidate gene studies were examined for association with t2d in african americans table s5 for the index snp association tests a persnp p value 005 was defined as significant in the locuswide analysis the boundaries of a locus were defined by the most distant markers within 500 kb using the 1kgp ceu data with r203 with the index snp all media snps within these bounds were examined for association analysis all pairwise ld values within each locus were estimated using the 1kgp ceu and asw data to estimate the effective number of snps at a locus we retrieved genotypes from the 1kgp asw data for markers present in media estimated the sample covariance matrix from those genotypes and spectrally decomposed the covariance matrix 24 the effective number of snps was estimated using the relationship  in which k is the k th eigenvalue of the kk covariance matrix for the k snps in the locus 24 the perlocus significance level was defined as 005effective number of snps table s6 by accounting for all snps within the bounds of ld the perlocus significance level is corrected to account for markers in ld with the index snp as well as markers not in ld with the index snp thereby potentially allowing for discovery of new associations at markers not tagged by the index snp
 
for each independent locus we estimated the sibling relative risk using the most strongly associated snp within that locus let pi and i be the risk allele frequency and the corresponding odds ratio at the i th snp respectively assuming the additive genetic model and independence between snps the contribution to the sibling relative risk s for a set of n snps is given by 56 let k be the disease prevalence the liabilityscale variance explained by the set of n snps is given by  in which   and  with representing the standard normal quantile function and z representing the standard normal density at t 57
 
the coverage of media snps to the human genome was estimated using haploview 58 via pairwise tagging at the r2  zero point eight threshold we used all snps with minor allele frequencies 1 in both media and the 1kgp asw sequence data coverage was estimated using nonoverlapping bins of 1000 snps
 
study power was calculated using the genetic power calculator 59 for snps with maf03 our study had 80 power to detect odds ratios for t2d at or106 and 113 at p005 and p5108 respectively in stage one samples under an additive model the observed odds ratios among our stage one most significantly associated snps with p1105 ranged from one point one one to one point five six table s4 given our african american sample size in stage 12a our study had 80 power to detect or11 at p5108 at maf03 thus provided good power to detect genomewide significance among the most significantly associated snps using all african american samples for t2d snps reported from the literature power was also calculated from the reported effect size using the risk allele frequency from this study for stage one samples at p005 and p5108 respectively table s5

an rp1d21h95 mutant line was generated from a cross between an rp1d21 variant and the maize inbred line h95 the ensuing f1 progeny was then backcrossed to the h95 parent four times while selecting for the hr phenotype marked by spontaneous lesion formation since the homozygous rp1d21h95 mutant lines are sterile it was maintained in a heterozygous state for further details of this line see chaikam et al 24 the rp1d21h95 line was crossed as a male to each of 3381 lines from nested association mapping nam population and to two hundred and twentyfive lines from the ibm population 96 to create a set of f1 families each of which segregated 11 wild typemutant for the presence and absence of the rp1d21induced hr phenotype but which were otherwise isogenic within a family
 
development of the maize nam populations has been previously described 32 56 this study used a subset from the nam population that is comprised of twentyfive biparental ril populations with b73 as a common parent and two hundred lines in each population the b73hp301 population was not included in our panel of 3381 lines since hp301 and about 88 of the derived lines in this population carry the ga1crossincompatibility gene making it very difficult to obtain f1 seed from these lines used as female parents 97 the selection of 3381 f1 families was based on the availability of seed f1 crosses derived from the ibm population were also included in the correlation analysis part of this study but excluded from the joint linkage and genomewide association gwa analysis
 
each of the 3606 f1 families including two hundred and twentyfive ibm lines was evaluated in four environments that comprised two locations clayton nc and west lafayette in and two years 2011 and 2012 with single replicate of the nam rils in each location an augmented randomized incomplete block design was implemented with the rp1d21h95 as repeated check to provide an estimate of experimental error each nam family was assigned to a block and a total of ten subblocks within each family block the rp1d21h95 check was included in each of the ten blocks in each nam family and in each location two rows of a constant genotype were planted around the edges of the field to minimize border row effect standard fertilizer pesticide and herbicide regimes were applied during the trial to ensure normal plant growth thinning to desired plant density and overhead irrigation were applied as required at clayton nc twelve kernels of each line were sown in two m rows with an interrow spacing of zero point nine seven m and a zero point six m alley at the end of each plot while at west lafayette in eighteen seeds were sown in six m rows with an interrow spacing of zero point seven six m
 
four lesionassociated traits lesion severity les mutant to wild type height ratio htr mutant to wild type stalk width ratio swr and mutant to wild type days to anthesis ratio dtar were scored each f1 family segregated 11 for the presence and absence of rp1d21 but was otherwise isogenic within a family it was immediately obvious by the presence or absence of lesions and by the growth habit of the plant which plants carries rp1d21 and which were wildtype for the les trait only plants carrying rp1d21 were scored while for htr swr and dtar both wild type and mutant classes were phenotyped separately and ratios between them derived
 
in all environments lesion severity scores were assigned based on a scale of one to ten figure s5 with 1 representing very few lesions and 10 indicating a completely dead plant 24 experiments were scored five times at clayton nc in both two thousand and eleven and two thousand and twelve point at west lafayette in plants were scored six and four times in years two thousand and eleven and 2012 respectively scoring was started one month after planting and continued at approximately 1014 day intervals
 
we scored an aberrant hr defense response rather than a disease symptom in this case but since the lesion phenotypes are generally similar to disease lesions we applied a widelyaccepted statistic in plant pathology standardized area under disease progress curve saudpc to quantitatively measure hr severity 98 for each environment the saudpc for les was calculated as follows the average value of two consecutive ratings was computed and multiplied by the number of days between the ratings values were summed over all intervals and then divided by the total number of days over which evaluations were performed to determine the weighted average
 
plant height data were collected after flowering from three representative mutant f1 individuals and from three representative wild type f1 individuals within each f1 family height means were calculated for each class within each family and the htr was calculated by dividing the average mutant type height to the average wild type height
 
stalk width immediately above the primary ear was measured on three representative mutant f1 individuals and three representative wild type f1 individuals within each f1 family swr was then calculated by dividing the average mutant stalk width to the wild type average stalk width
 
plants were monitered every other day for the date when 50 of the wild type and 50 of the mutant plants in an f1 family were shedding pollen the days from planting to anthesis were computed for the wild type and the mutant plants in each family dtar was then calculated by dividing the days to anthesis for mutants by days to anthesis for wild type plants
 
disease scores for slb southern leaf blight cochliobolus heterostrophus gls gray leaf spot cercospora zeaemaydis and nlb northern leaf blight exserohilum turcicum were obtained from previous studies 3335 these data were used to evaluate the correlation between disease resistance and hr severity in response to rp1d21 aberrant phenotype lesion mimics
 
the least square ls mean data used for analysis can be found in file s6 file s7 and figure s1 gives the metadata for each of the populations to obtain least square mean values adjusted for environmental effects data were analyzed with a mixed model considering line as a fixed effect and environment block within environment population by environment and linebyenvironment interaction within population as random effects using proc mixed in sas v93 99 the reml walds z statistic was used to test the significance of each random factor in the model 100 least squares means for lines were estimated from this mixed model and used as the input phenotype for association analysis for the purpose of estimating heritability a mixed model with all factors including lines as random effects was used correlations between disease scores slb gls and nlb and lesion mimic traits for each line were estimated using proc corr in sas v93 99 the nam subpopulation groups considered as a covariate were accounted for during correlation analysis
 
a total of seven thousand three hundred and eightysix snp markers scored on all four thousand eight hundred and ninetytwo available nam rils were used for linkage and qtl analyses files s8 s9 the marker values were imputed at zero point two cm intervals based on snp calls made from short sequence reads using the gbs protocol 101 briefly each sample was digested with the apek1 restriction enzyme pcr amplified multiplexed sequenced and then processed through a custom snp calling pipeline because the sequence coverage was low about 05 two problems arose first many sites had more than 50 missing data and second at many heterozygous sites only a single allele of the two possible alleles was detected as a result about 80 of the heterozygous sites were scored as homozygous to deal with these issues each snp call was first scored as either the b73 or nonb73 parent then the viterbi algorithm was applied to the resulting sequence to identify probable heterozygous loci and genotype calling errors sites were then chosen at zero point two cm intervals and values for each site imputed as two probability allele came from the nonb73 parent based on the nearest nonmissing flanking markers where both flanking markers came from the same parent the value was either zero or two point where the markers came from different parents the value was intermediate and based on the relative distance from the two markers 59
 
for the gwa analysis a total of about twentysix point five million snps polymorphic among the nam founder lines were obtained from the hapmapv2 project 57 the data at each locus are comprised of two alleles per snp with the minor alleles set to one and everything else to zero point the data were recoded to reduce computational time during projection by setting b73 alleles common parental allele to zero and nonb73 alleles alternate allele to one point projection of the twentysix point five million hapmap v2 nam founder genotypes on the nam rils was performed based on the genotype of the rils diverse founderparental lines at each of the twentysix point five million hapmap v2 snp and an individual rils genotype calls at the nam snp markers flanking the physical position of the hapmap v2 snp because we used the high density seven thousand three hundred and eightysix nam snp marker linkage map each interval was only zero point two cm in genetic distance permitting very accurate imputation of hapmap v2 snps if the diverse founderparental line has the same homozygous allele as b73 at both flanking loci the ril genotype is assigned a b73 allele coded as 0 for a snp position when the diverse founderparental line carries an alternatenonb73 allele homozygous at both flanking loci the probability that the ril carries the alternate allele is computed as the weighted average of the flanking mapped nam snp genotype with the weights assigned based on the relative physical position of the hapmap snp within the interval this is computed aswhere d two is the physical distance between the hapmap v2 snp and the righthand mapped nam snp g one is the genotype score at the mapped nam snp d one is the physical distance between the hapmap v2 snp and the lefthand mapped nam snp and g two is the genotype score at the righthand mapped nam snp
 
the singleindependent population qtl analysis was performed based on composite interval mapping cim and implemented in the windows qtl cartographer software v25 102 permutation tests set to an alphalevel of zero point zero five were performed to determine population and trait specific lod thresholds at aprroximately 30 linkage and qtl maps were prepared using the mapchart software v22 103
 
jointlinkage mapping was implemented as previously described 56 before the joint stepwise regression procedure in proc glmselect was implemented in sas software v93 lod thresholds were established following 1000 traitdependent permutation tests based on alpha set at zero point zero five with the model containing a family main effect trait specific qtl lod thresholds of 544 500 four point two seven and eight point three four were obtained and applied to detect qtl for les htr swr and dtar respectively the model included family main effects and a single marker effects nested within families the lowest resulting p value among marker tests was obtained for each permutation
 
following initial detection of qtl loci the stepwise regression model was optimized with an iterative process by sequentially dropping a marker in the model testing the fit of adjacent markers until the eighth marker 16 cm away from the originally selected marker and fitting the best marker in the region back into the model allele effects at each marker included in the final model were estimated simultaneously using the solution option of proc glm in sas software v93 the ttests of the null hypothesis of zero allele effect were performed for each nam founder allele effect at each qtl the qtl support intervals were computed in the sas software v93 by adding a single flanking marker to the full model one at a time from the qtl at a step of zero point two cm this was performed at the left and right side of the qtl the support interval boundary was considered to be the last marker at which the qtl regained significance at the p  zero point zero five level
 
to test for significant digenic epistatic interactions a subset of one thousand four hundred and nine snp markers were obtained from the available seven thousand three hundred and eightysix snp markers at uniform one cm intervals and all pairwise combinations of the one thousand four hundred and nine markers were tested separately using models that included population main effects the two marker main effects nested in populations and the markermarker interaction nested in populations by extending the method of holland 104 the analysis was performed across the twentyfour nam families while the traitspecific qtl lod thresholds were estimated based on a permutation test at a critical value with alpha less than 5 marker pair interactions with pvalues less than the permutation testbased threshold were considered for inclusion in the final joint linkage model without regard to the signficance of the main effects of the markers each such pair of markers and their interaction were added to the final additive joint linkage model one at a time the pvalue of the interaction in this full model was used to determine if the epistatic interaction improved the model fit
 
gwa models were fit for each chromosome one at a time for each chromosome line residual values from the final joint linkage qtl model excluding all markers on the chromosome under consideration were computed in sas software v93 using twentysix point five million snps gwa genome wide association analysis was performed based on forward regression of the hapmap v2 snps to subsamples of these phenotypic residual values adjusted for qtl on other chromosomes to identify snps with the most robust associations with traits we implemented a subsampling subagging procedure during the gwa analysis 105 with forward regression using a pvalue threshold for inlcusion in the model of 1106 106 performed in each of one hundred subsample datasets each subsample dataset comprised 80 of the rils from each nam family 34 51 a population main effect was included in the model prior to the addition of snp terms during the forward selection the effect estimate of each significant snp in each subsample was also computed and averaged over the one hundred subsamples the resample model inclusion probability rmip was computed for each snp as the proportion of subsample data sets in which it was included in the final regression model only snps with rmip 005 are shown on the manhattan plot following valdar et al 2006 an rmip threshold of zero point two five was used to report the most robust snp associations
 
genes colocalizing with or adjacent to associated snps were determined using the maize b73 reference genome assembly v2 available on the maizegdb genome browser 107 or the wwwmaizesequenceorg genome browser 108 functional annotations of the candidate genes were determined using blastp 109 conserved domain search tools 110 and annotations avialble at the maize genome database  further annotation was achieved by inspection of the literature specific to each gene and domain file s5
 
wildtype wt and mutant plants in b73rp1d21h95 and mo17rp1d21h95 backgrounds growing in constant 22c with twelve hday12 hdark were used for rna extraction the 3rd true leaves of five individual seedlings collected from 18day old wt or mutant plants were pooled and total rna was isolated using trizol reagent life technologies according to manufacturers instructions rna concentration and quality were monitored by the nanodrop and agarose gel electrophoresis mrna was isolated from the total rna by dynabeads oligodt life technologies following manufacturers directions rnaseq libraries were constructed according to the truseq rna sample prep v2 ls protocol illumina and sequenced using the illumina hiseq two thousand point two biological replicates each consisting of five individual plants and two technical replicates two lanes were performed with one hundred nt single end reads the sequences were aligned to maize genome sequence v2 wwwmaizegdborg via tophat two point zero 111 using all the default parameter settings the raw counts per gene were calculated using inhouse scripts only reads with unique alignments were maintained for subsequent analyses genes with total read counts less than twenty were filtered out differentially expressed genes degs were identified using the software package edger from the bioconductor suite 112 to account for multiple testing the procedure of benjamini and hochberg 113 for controlling the false discovery rate fdr was applied using a threshold of q  zero point zero five to determine significance

embryonic heart or limb tissue was isolated from cd1 strain mouse embryos at e115 by microdissection in cold pbs 27 a single sample consisting of tissue pooled from multiple embryos was analyzed for either tissue after washing about one ml trizol reagent life technologies 15596026 was added to every one hundred mg of tissue sample followed by homogenization using a glass dounce homogenizer total rna from individual tissues were extracted following the manufacturers instructions genomic dna contamination was removed by using the turbo dnafree kit applied biosystems am1907 following manufactures protocol and the rna samples were stored at 80c before further processing
 
in order to perform the transcriptome analysis by illumina sequencing ribosomal rnas was removed from total rna 510 g per reaction by using two rounds of the ribominus eukaryote kit for rnaseq life technologies a1083708 following the manufacturers instructions the quality of total rna after rrna removal was analyzed on rna six thousand pico chip agilent 50671513 to assure that rrna contamination was less than 30 one hundred ng total rna after rrna removal were used to construct the individual sequencing libraries for illumina sequencing strandspecific rnaseq libraries were created following inhouse protocols briefly rna samples were fragmented with 10fragment buffer ambion am9938 to achieve an average fragment size of 200300 nt first strand cdna synthesis was performed with random hexamer and superscript ii reverse transcriptase life technologies 18064014 during the second strand synthesis dutp was used instead of dttp to introduce strandspecificity after adaptor ligation and size selection the second strand containing dutp was cleaved by amperase ung life technologies n8080096 the resulting strandspecific cdna was subjected to twelve cycles of pcr amplification and sequenced with hiseq two thousand instrument fifty sequencing cycles were carried out
 
raw illumina reads 50 bp were first filtered using the illumina casava18 fastq filter module  the remaining sequence tags were mapped back to the mouse genome ncbi build 37 mm9 using bowtie2 41 and the alignments were extended to two hundred bp in the 3 direction to account for the average length of dna fragments repetitively mapped reads were excluded from the following analysis for de novo peak calling a sliding window method enrichedregionmaker module from useq 42 was employed for ernabased enhancer predictions a conservative threshold of ten or more reads without considering strand specificity was chosen based on the observation that in retrospective comparison with in vivo validated enhancers 407 of enhancers met or exceeded this expression threshold compared to 45 of random control regions p  55e108 table s2 enriched regions overlapping with refgene mouse mrna or ests mm9 were also removed before the downstream analysis this process was performed individually for heart and limb rnaseq data to generate figure s2b 10 to 100 of sequencing reads were randomly selected from the raw sequencing data and de novo peak calling was individually performed to identify the enriched intergenic regions
 
among raw enriched regions tissuespecifically transcribed regions tstrs were defined as noncoding regions with significantly higher expression in this tissue compared with the other tissue p001 twoproportion ztest figure 3ab  43 with the equation shown belowwhere n represents mappable reads within each tstr in heart or limb and n represent the total number of mappable reads excluding ribosomal regions in the corresponding tissue and  rpkm29 were arbitrarily set to 29 for visualization purposes in figure 3ab 
 
candidate transcription start sites tsss marked by cage peaks were downloaded from  30 and extended to one kb each side from the peak midpoint for each tstr 1 kb around the peak center the overlapping candidate tsss were identified by bedtools 44 random control peaks were also generated using bedtools with the same number and size of sequences and excluding known genes mouse mrnas and ests
 
we compared tissuederived rna signatures at intergenic regions to enhancerassociated p300 27 and h3k27ac marks from the same tissues and timepoint h3k27ac chipseq datasets are described in more detail in nord et al 29 and attanasio et al 45 candidate tissuespecific intergenic enhancers were predicted by chipseq of p300 171 in heart six hundred and fiftysix in limb or h3k27ac 6965 in heart two thousand one hundred and seventyfour in limb as described previously 27 briefly uniquely aligned sequencing reads were extended to three hundred bp in the 3 direction enriched regions peaks were identified with macs 46 p1e5 using matched input as controls peaks overlapping with repetitive regions known genes mouse mrnas and ests were removed for further analysis
 
summary erna coverage plots were generated for p300 andor h3k27acderived intergenic enhancers within a ten kb window centering on the maximum chipseq coverage using the mapped reads normalized mean erna coverage values were calculated for twentyfive bp windows across the ten kb regions scaled by total mapped reads for mean calculations only the 5th95th percentiles were used to reduce the effect of outliers coverage was calculated separately for antisense and sense reads and as a combined value for the summary plots a loess best fit line was plotted for each of the erna datasets limb and heart separating into sense and antisense reads  figure 2cf 
 
precomputed conservation scores phastcons scores generated from thirty vertebrate genome alignments were download from the ucsc genome browser 47 for each tstr 1 kb around the peak center the conservation score was defined as the most highly constrained overlapping phastcons element in the mouse mm9 genome random control peaks were generated using bedtools with the same number and size of sequences and excluding known genes mouse mrnas and ests 44 the percentages of tstrs and random control regions overlapping phastcons elements were plotted in figure 4a 
 
tissuespecific tstrs were classified as enriched in p300 andor h3k27ac if the relative chipseq coverage was equal to or greater than the 95th percentile of experiment background coverage estimated across one mb of unique sequence after classification coverage heatmaps were generated for chipseq data using normalized coverage values with input corrections coverage was plotted for twentyfive bp windows centered on the peak rna coverage and extending twentyfive kb on either side for plotting purposes coverage was centered and scaled using mean and sd in order to compare signal across datasets tstrs were organized as no h3k27ac and p300 signal enriched in h3k27ac signal only enriched in p300 signal only and enriched in both marks from the top to the bottom in figure 4cd 
 
known heart or limb enhancers were downloaded from vista enhancer browser  for known enhancer regions the expression level of individual ernas was defined as the mapped sequencing reads within a two kb window around the center of in vivo tested enhancers for ernas only expressed in one tissue the mapped number of reads was arbitrarily set to one in the other tissue in order to compute the absolute fold change for plotting purposes in figure 2b  fold change was defined as higher expression level divided by lower expression of each erna in two tissues for the volcano plot y axis represents pvalue for the expression differences of each known enhancer which was computed by twoproportion ztest 43
 
coverage of randomly selected control regions excluding known genes mrna and ests was also computed and iterated one hundred times to estimate the genomewide background based on normal distribution the percentages of enhancers or the average percentage of control regions with indicated numbers of uniquely mapped reads in either tissue are listed in table s2 as well as associated pvalues
 
after peak calling for each individual tstr normalized rpkm reads per kilobase per million mapped reads was calculated in two tissues heart and limb with the raw mapped rnaseq data within a two kb window around the center of each tstr then a tissuespecificity index was computed as susu in which s is the expression of tstr in the matching tissue and u is its expression in the other tissue the expression of mouse refgene mm9 was also analyzed in the same way by computing the rpkm across annotated cdna regions in two tissues
 
the tissuespecific expression correlation between tstrs and their nearby genes was computed as described 18 with minor modifications briefly we paired each tstr with the nearby genes for each set of genes with the same ranked distance to tstrs the first to the fifth closest genes genes were ranked based on tissuespecificity indices and grouped into twenty genes per bin average tissuespecificity indices from each bin were used to compute the correlation the pearson correlation between nearby genes and the corresponding tstrs was conducted with the statistics module in the r package 
 
gene ontology analysis for the genes near tstr regions was performed by great version two point zero two 48 enriched go biological processes with a binomial pvalue and fold enrichment were listed in table one 
 
for tstrs in heart and limb enriched motifs were computed within a two kb window around the center of individual tstrs by the motif finding module of homer hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment 49 known motifs for transcription factors with a pvalue less than 102 compared with random genomic sequences were reporter in table s5 and table s6
 
for directionality analysis the expression of individual tstrs in sense and antisense strands was defined as the strandspecific mapped sequencing reads within a two kb window around the center of tstrs in either heart or limb then the directionality index was defined as frfr in which f is the expression of tstr in one strand and r is its expression in the other strand in the same tissue
 
total rna was extracted from independently collected pools of heart or limb tissues with the same method as described before and synthesized into cdna by reverse transcription using the superscript firststrand synthesis system invitrogen candidate tstrs for rtpcr validations were randomly selected from the top 30 differentially expressed regions ranked by z scores expression analysis of candidate tstrs was carried out by realtime pcr using genespecific primers table s4 and kapa sybr fast qpcr master mix kapa biosystems on a roche lightcycler four hundred and eighty point all primers were designed in silico using primer3  and tested for amplification efficiency target gene expression was calculated with the 2ct method 50 and normalized to the gapdh housekeeping gene

for genotyping msh6 snp rs1800934 in an independent set of germline dna from thirtythree samples a six hundred and thirtytwo bp amplimer was generated from gdna using 5gtagtccgcccacctaagc forward and 5ccctagctctctacttcttaccaaaa reverse the primers were appended with universal sequences at their 5ends 5tgtaaaacgacggccagt forward 5caggaaacagctatgacc reverse pcr and sequencing was performed as described above
 
for genotyping dph2 snps rs4660761 and rs7161 we used genotyping calls obtained from illumina human omniquad1m snparrays snparray analysis was done according to the manufacturers protocol using genomestudio v 20102 software illumina
 
a targeted multiplex pcr primer panel was designed using the custom ion ampliseq designer v30 thermo fisher scientific life technologies carlsbad ca usa the primer panel covered eleven kb of sequence that includes the specific variants of interest in the msh6 and dph2 loci each site was 100 covered in the design average amplicon size was two hundred and twentyfive bp sample dna was amplified using this custom ampliseq primer pool and libraries were prepared following the manufacturers ion ampliseq library preparation protocol life technologies carlsbad ca usa individual samples were barcoded pooled templated and sequenced on the ion torrent pgm sequencer using the ion pgm template ot2 two hundred and ion pgm sequencing 200v2 kits per manufacturers instructions mean read length after sequencing was one hundred and fiftynine bp
 
the calm count trait was used both as the untransformed unt and as the logtransformed trait log by log10x10 single nucleotide variants snvs from the five selected candidate genes msh6 msh2 mlh1 med21 and dph2 were filtered based on the with the following 1 if the polyphred score for an snv was less than 99 the genotype was deemed missing 2 if a sample had greater than 30 of its snvs missing then the sample was excluded 3 if an snv had a greater than 20 missing rate in all of the samples the snv was excluded and 4 all monomorphic snvs were excluded in those cases in which family data were available snvs were checked for mendelian segregation with pedcheck 70 hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe proportions were tested with pedstats 71 on seventy unrelated individuals two snvs not in hwe p value003 were flagged but retained for analysis since removing snvs not in hwe in highlyascertained samples may remove causative snvs selfreported europeanamerican samples were included for further analyses after filtering there were a total of ninetyone individuals with one hundred and eighteen snvs
 
simple linear regression was performed on each snv after adjusting for age and sex tiled regression as implemented in trap tiled regression analysis package 72 was used to identify the set of independent significant variants considering all the snvs in the sample that affected the number of calm after preadjusting for age and sex both simple linear regression and tiled regression were performed under two models additive and dominant for both the untransformed and logtransformed traits briefly in tiled regression the genome is divided into independent segments based on predefined regions called tiles in this study tiles were defined by hotspotbased regions delimited by the location of recombination hotspots in human genome sequence build 36 yielding five independent tiles each tile was first analyzed with multiple linear regression of the trait on all snvs in the tile and by simple linear regression of the trait on each snv separately only those tiles for which the overall multiple linear regression showed a significant relationship to trait variation at the level of 02 or in which simple linear regression on any single snv was significant at the level of 005 were retained for subsequent analyses a forward stepwise regression with backward look then was performed within each tile to select the important individual independent snvs identified with a critical level of zero point zero five for entry and for retention in the model thereafter the snvs retained from each tile were combined across tiles for higher order stepwise regressions at chromosome and then whole genome levels using the same critical values the end result was a multiple linear regression model that included the set of variants independently contributing to trait variation
 
genotypes for one hundred and eighteen svs including both fiftyeight common and sixty rare variants defined by minor allele frequency 005 were used as provided uncollapsed and with the rare variants rvs collapsed several coding schemes were considered 1 the number of minor alleles add for each common variant cv and for each uncollapsed rv 2 the presence or absence of the minor allele dom for each snv and for each uncollapsed rv 3 the number of minor alleles add for each cv and with a new collapsed variant that was coded as proportion of a minor allele at any rv in other words collapsing multiple rvs into a single regionwide variant within hotspotbased region definition
 
to confirm the association of snvs in the disc sample set with calm count we genotyped the variants in germline dna in an independent set of thirtythree samples rep1 and an additional independent set of eightyone samples rep2 since none of the significant snvs in the disc set were significantly associated with calm count by simple linear regression at the level of zero point zero five based on twentynine and sixtytwo europeanamerican samples in rep1 and rep2 respectively table 2 we performed additional analyses in the metaanalysis pvalues of these three disc rep1 rep2 datasets were combined using liptaks method 73 by weighting each pvalue by its square root of the sample size table 2 in the megaanalysis three disc rep1 rep2 datasets including one hundred and eighty samples were combined and simple linear regression was performed on each snv by adjusting for age sex and each dataset table 2 tiled regression was not performed in the replication study since the method requires genotyping all variants not just markers of interest we did not attempt to validate rare variants due to limited size of the additional set
 
to explore whether snps rs4660761 and rs7161 might have potential regulatory functions in skin cells including melanocytes we used custom tracks on the ucsc genome browser  to screen roadmap and encode data containing the implicated snp regions for evidence for regulatory relevance 7476 such as overlapping with chromatin marks and interactions cpgsite methylation and transcription factor binding motifs we also used the online tools haploreg  and regulomedb  as a complementary analysis and to confirm the location of each snp in relation to annotated proteincoding genes andor noncoding rna ncrna genes

in order to explore the level of functional constraint in ifnl4 we estimated the level of protein conservation in primate and nonprimate mammals specifically we assessed the ratio dnds of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site dn to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ds across gene orthologs since purifying selection eliminates deleterious proteincoding changes dnds decreases with negative selection and increases with relaxed constraint and positive selection
 
we used human ifnl4 reference sequence nm0012762542 to blat genomes of other species and generate multiplespecies sequence alignment of ifnl4 coding exons one through five table s8 the pandapredicted ifnl4 ortholog was subsequently used as blat query to extract coding exons for additional nonprimate species table s8 further we sequenced ifnl4 exons and introns in genomic dna and reconstructed complete ifnl4 cdna sequences of chimpanzee genbank accession jx867772 baboon genbank accession kc525947 and crabeating macaque genbank accession kc525948 the whole ifnl4 genomic region is absent in mouse or rat all discovered functional ifnl4 sequences table s8 where used for a multiplesequence alignment which was created using clustalw 52 and annotated with jalview 53
 
the alignment was analyzed with codeml part of paml4 54 to test various models of selection we estimated the overall dnds for the complete tree and compared likelihoods for models that allowed i free dnds for each branch ie lineage heterogeneity ii a primatespecific dnds and iii a humanspecific dnds additionally we performed tests aimed to detect sitespecific signatures of positive selection across the phylogeny branch models i model 1a neutral vs model two positive selection ii model seven neutral vs model eight with dnds1 and iii model 8a with dnds  1 vs model eight with dnds1
 
we analyzed genomewide data from the one thousand genomes release 20101123 phase i 24 we considered 1 autosomal variants detected in the low coverage sequencing and 2 populations with information for at least fifty unrelated individuals which was met by thirteen populations from four different continents african ancestry yri yoruba in ibadan nigeria lwk luhya in webuye kenya asw african ancestry in southwest us european ancestry gbr british from england and scotland ceu utah residents ceph with northern and western european ancestry fin finnish from finland tsi toscani in italia east asian ancestry chs han chinese south chb han chinese in beijing china jpt japanese in toyko japan american ancestry mxl mexican ancestry in los angeles ca clm colombian in medellin colombia pur puerto rican in puerto rico as an exception pur puerto rico was analyzed although it contains only fortyfour individuals some analyses were performed both by population and by continent in these cases the continental groups contain one hundred and fifty randomly selected unrelated individuals america 144 with an equal contribution from each population within the continent
 
for the rs368234815 gtt frameshiftsubstitution variant the one thousand genomes dataset only contains the t insertiondeletion variant rs11322783 t chr1939739154 dbsnp b138 while the substitution rs74597329 gt chr1939739155 dbsnp b138 is absent this is due to the automatic variant caller failing to correctly identify an insertion and a substitution in the same genomic position we sequenced an amplicon containing rs368234815 in one hundred and fiftythree individuals included both in the one thousand genomes and hapmap sets ceu yri and chbjpt sequencing confirmed the presence of only two alleles g and tt and showed good concordance with the one thousand genomes data between our gtt genotypes and one thousand genomes genotypes for the overlapping insertiondeletion variant rs11322783 4 individuals of one hundred and fiftythree tested were discordant providing an estimated 974 genotype and 987 allele concordance rate this validated the use of one thousand genomes dataset for our subsequent analyses we used the ancestral allelic state annotated in the one thousand genomes data which is based on the ensembl fiftynine comparative thirtytwo species alignment 55 only snps with a highconfidence ancestral inference were used and indels were excluded due to their cryptic variation patterns 56
 
we used fst ihs and xpehh to explore the signatures of selection of rs368234815 tt allele fst is a measure of population differentiation and unusually high fst can indicate populationspecific positive selection that drastically increases allele frequency in the population under selection 57 to calculate fst we used the weir and cockerham 25 estimator implemented in vcftools 58
 
positively selected alleles rapidly increase in frequency with recombination having little chance to break their association with nearby variants if the selected allele was originally in few haplotype backgrounds and it has not reached fixation it will be associated with extended haplotype homozygosity ehh a pattern that will be absent for the nonselected allele we used two statistics to explore this expectation first ihs 27 measures the allelespecific decay of ehh within a population by comparing the associated ehh of ancestral and derived alleles second xpehh 26 that detects alleles that are under selection in one population only by comparing ehh patterns both among allelic types and across populations as such xpehh has higher power to detect populationspecific selection low frequency variants break the ehh signal so following 59 we considered only snps with derived allele frequency  5 for xpehh or minor allele frequency  5 for ihs local recombination rate estimates were obtained from a combined recombination map based on hapmap data 60 from africa european and asian populations both statistics were standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for ihs scores were then binned by frequency 1 as previously suggested 27 correlation of fst with xpehh chs vs yri or ihs chs was calculated for all variants present in the respective dataset with spearmans rank correlation test implemented in r 61
 
we used each of these statistics to analyze every nonafrican population for betweenpopulation comparisons we used yoruba as background unless noted otherwise to assess the putative effects of this choice of populations we repeated the analyses for continental groups for different background populations and for snps that have their lowest allele frequency in yoruba in all cases the empirical pvalues were obtained by comparing the score for rs368234815 to the wholegenome empirical distribution of the respective statistic since this is a hypothesisdriven analysis with a single variant analyzed within a single locus no multiple testing or genomewide corrections are needed
 
we also applied tests that analyze the signatures of selection in the ifnl4 genetic region 25 kb here we show results for fay and wus h test 28 which detects the excess of highfrequency derived alleles expected after a recent sweep with recombination significance was estimated using 10000 standard neutral coalescent simulations 62 because demography affects the sfs and can cause spurious results if not properly accounted for our simulations are run under a demographic model which includes inferred parameters for populations of african 63 european 63 asian 63 and american 64 ancestry a custom made perl program neutrality test pipeline was used to calculate the statistic and corresponding pvalue
 
to infer the model of selection that best fits ifnl4 data and estimate the timing and selection strength of the tt allele we used an approximate bayesian computation abc approach 22 in particular we followed a published approach 23 which has been previously shown to discriminate well between sdn ssv and neutrality ntr 23 in brief this approach is based on performing a large number of simulations under different selection models with random parameters drawn from some probability distribution called the prior distribution real data and simulations are compared based on summary statistics and through a rejection scheme the simulations that most closely resemble real data help inform inferences about the bestfitting model the parameter values that generate these simulations are then used to obtain the posterior distribution of each parameter whose mean and standard deviation are used to perform the parameter inferences we extended the method to consider more than one population since twopopulation statistics are most informative in our case
 
specifically the approach uses msms 65 to simulate data custom python scripts to calculate all summary statistics and abctoolbox 66 for all abc inferences under both selection models we started with uniform priors with a range as follow see fig 5a
 
sdn model  selection strength in africa sau015 selection strength in nonafrica snau055 time when selection started tmutu4070kya
 
ssv model  selection strength in nonafrica snau05 frequency of the allele when selection started f0u020 time when selection started tmutu2151kya
 
ntr model  time when mutation appears tu4070kya
 
because simulations with the selected allele fixed are likely to be very different from the observed data we conditioned on the selected allele segregating in both populations this resulted in nonuniform prior distributions presented in figure s5 and s6 we used one hundred and four simulations to distinguish between the neutral model and the two selection models and a larger set of 8105 simulations for the more subtle distinction between the two selection models and for parameter estimation for the simulations we used the population history model estimated by gravel et al 63 and assumed a constant recombination rate of one point seven six cmmb throughout the region average recombination rate in the ifnl locus 60 and a perfectly additive model of dominance h  05 lack of an appropriate demographic model for american and nonyoruba african populations precludes analysis for those populations the following singlepopulation statistics were calculated the average number of pairwise differences  wattersons  fay and wus h 28 and tajimas d 67 all for both four kb around the site and a eight kb 6 kb upstream and two kb downstream of the site interval around the tt allele the betweenpopulation statistics employed were fst 68 for the selected site fst in four kb around the site fst for the whole region and xpehh on the selected site 26 in addition we also included the frequency of the selected allele in both populations this resulted in a set of sixteen summary statistics which following wegmann et al 69 and peter et al 23 was reduced to seven summary statistics using plsda 70 for model choice and regular pls for parameter inference 71 performance of the abc model choice and parameter distribution for the sdn model has been assessed for each particular model note s3 confidence in the choice of selection models has been supported with bayes factors
 
in addition we investigated the influence of the dominance model in our inferences we analyzed a recessive model for tt h  0 the perfectly additive model above h  05 and a supraadditive model h  038 using 500000 simulations for each model we run an abc analysis for model selection with all simulations from all three dominance models and the three selection models ntr sdn and ssv we then assess the posterior probability of each dominance model regardless of selection model and the posterior probability and parameter estimates of each selection model for the additive and supraadditive dominance models see note s4

yeast strains used are isogenic to strain 7796a mata suq5 kar11 ade21 his3202 leu21 trp163 ura352 70 which is used for monitoring psi and pin knockouts and replacements of chromosomal genes were done using standard transformation procedures 71 strain mr386 has e coli clpb in place of the chromosomal hsp104 gene 15 and contains plasmids expressing e coli dnakr167h pmr150lgr167h and e coli grpe pmr134h under the control of the gpd glyceraldehyde3phosphate dehydrogenase  tdh3 and fes1 promoters respectively psi  is maintained in strain mr386 by pj312 which is hsp104 on a ura3 plasmid 72 strain mr502 has ydj1kanmx and carries p316ydj1 which is ydj1 on a ura3 plasmid psi pin strain nine hundred and thirty has sis1kanmx and carries plasmid pyw17 a ura3based plasmid encoding wild type sis1 22 32
 
strain 930a is a psi pin version of nine hundred and thirty that carries plasmid p313rnq1gfp it was cured of psi by transient growth on medium containing three mm guanidine and then pin clones among psi isolates were identified by punctate rnq1gfp fluorescence our pin variant is uncharacterized but of the singledot type which typically has sturdier fibers and a lower seed number per cell than multidot pin 61 isogenic strain 1075 for monitoring ure3 has ade2 regulated by the dal5 promoter pdal5ade2 see below in place of ade21 43 strain one thousand three hundred and eightyfive is strain one thousand and seventyfive with sis1kanmx and plasmid pyw17 which is sis1 on a ura3 plasmid strains one thousand four hundred and eight and one thousand four hundred and ten are hsp104 versions of strain 7796a and 1075 respectively 15 both carry pj312 our parental strains carry only one variant of psi ure3 or pin
 
sis1 plasmids used contain wild type and mutant sis1 alleles on the prs314 singlecopy trp1 vector 22 32 plasmid pru4 is leu2based singlecopy plasmid prs415 containing the gal1 promoter and cyc1 terminator flanking the polylinker sites spei and xhoi for galinduced expression ydj1 and hybrid alleles were inserted into pru4 as bamhisali fragments all plasmids used in this study are listed in table one point plasmids encoding e coli genes or yeast hsp40 genes with d36n mutations are described 15
 
see materials and methods section for details of construction all plasmids are cen single copy unless otherwise indicated with 2micron high copy all pmr and pru plasmids contain the cyc1 terminator sequence immediately downstream of the orf
 
with the exceptions that 12ypd plates contain five gl yeast extract ypad plates contain four hundred mgl excess adenine and solid defined media contain ten mgl limiting adenine standard media and growth conditions were used 71
 
sis1 and ydj1 have clearly defined and characterized jdomains glycinephenylalanine gf rich middle domains and a cterminal region that contains two major elements ctdi and ctdii and a dimerization domain the main structural differences between sis1 and ydj1 are a glycinemethioninerich gm extension of the gf domain in sis1 which has gfredundant functions and a znfinger domain zf embedded between betastrands two and three of the ctdi of ydj1 that is absent in sis1 73 because the zf of ydj1 is an integral part of ctdi we designed our sis1ydj1 hybrids using the gfctdi junction to restrict the number of domain swaps and avoid using complicated junctions to swap the zf region rather than designating the gm region as a separate domain we combined the functionally redundant gf and gm regions of sis1 into a single domain thus hybrid alleles were made by swapping three regions the jdomain the glycinerich region and the cterminal portion which includes ctdi ctdii and the dimerization domains herein referred to simply as the ctd see figure 1a 30 hybrid genes were synthesized by genewiz inc south plainfield nj and subcloned into variants of prs414 that placed the orf under the control of the sis1 ydj1 or gpd promoters and a downstream cyc1 transcriptional terminator 74 all constructs contained a cterminal cmyc tag that had no noticeable affect on functions in vivo
 
depletion of the ribosome release factor sup35 by its sequestration in psi prion aggregates causes nonsense suppression we monitored psi by suppression of the ade21 nonsense allele in our strains psi cells are ade and white while psi cells are ade and when grown on limiting adenine are red due to accumulation of a metabolite of adenine biosynthesis the presence of ure3 was monitored similarly by use of an ade2 allele regulated by the dal5 promoter pdal5ade2 75 76 under standard growth conditions ure2 represses transcription of nitrogen metabolic genes such as dal5 ure3 sequesters ure2 into prion aggregates thereby reducing ure2 function and activating the dal5 promoter thus ure3 cells are ade and white while ureo cells are ade and red on limiting adenine we confirmed that ade phenotypes were due to the presence of prions by their guanidine curability and by crosses with cells lacking prions to produce a dominant guanidinecurable ade phenotype we monitored pin by assessing aggregation status of a plasmidexpressed rnq1gfp fusion protein gfp fluorescence is diffuse in pin cells but noticeably punctate in pin cells in this study we used a typical strong psi strain and single variants of ure3 and pin prions
 
microscopic analysis of rnq1gfp fluorescence in live cells was done with a nikon e800 microscope with log phase cells grown in medium selecting for the plasmid encoding the rnq1gfp fusion protein images were captured using ivision software and processed using adobe photoshop software
 
log phase cells grown in medium selecting for plasmids were diluted in fresh medium to an od600 of zero point two five and one hundred l was transferred to zero point five ml test tubes and placed in a pcr machine for thermocycling as indicated at various times aliquots were removed and placed on ice cooled cells were serially diluted and five l drops were spotted onto ypad plates
 
strains nine hundred and thirty and one thousand three hundred and eightyfive both sis1 and derivatives of mr502 ydj1 carrying wild type sis1 or ydj1 on ura3based plasmids were transformed by trp1based plasmids carrying wild type mutant or hybrid alleles strain mr502 also carries pmr169 for monitoring gal induction see below transformants were grown as patches of cells on medium lacking both tryptophan and uracil and then replicaplated onto similar medium containing uracil to allow loss of the ura3 plasmid these were then replicaplated onto medium containing 5foa which kills cells that did not lose the resident ura3 plasmid
 
for sis1 growth on 5foa plates shows complementation of functions essential for growth and growth without adenine shows complementation of sis1 functions required for prion propagation to test complementation of ydj1 function 5foa resistant cells of strain mr502 were grown overnight in medium selecting for the trp1 plasmids normalized to the same cell density od600  025 and fivefold serially diluted aliquots of the dilutions 5 l were then dropped onto ypad plates scanned images of the plates were taken after they were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 34 days
 
aliquots of overnight cultures of mr502 transformants used for growth complementation were transferred to synthetic raffinose medium sraf and grown overnight these cells carried the trp1marked hybrid alleles or empty vector control and a his3marked plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the gal10 promoter pmr169 cell densities were adjusted to od600  zero point three in fresh medium and the initial reading t  0 was taken by mixing one hundred l culture with fifty l of one mm luciferin in zero point one m sodium citrate ph five point zero immediately before reading in a zylux femtomaster luminometer with a ten s delay and five s read time galactose from a 20 stock was then added to the cultures to obtain a final concentration of 2 and the cells were incubated on a roller at 30c readings were taken at 30 sixty and one hundred and twenty minutes after addition of galactose all samples in three experiments were tested in triplicate no significant growth occurred during the course of the experiment
 
overnight sd cultures of cells carrying ydj1 or hybrid alleles on pru4 for galactose induction were used to inoculate sgal medium to od600  zero point zero five and incubated with shaking at 30c generations were monitored as doublings of od600 cultures were subcultured as necessary to keep the od600 less than 20 after 3 six and nine generations of growth in galactose aliquots were removed and cells plated onto 12ypd plates loss of ure3 was assessed by determining the fraction of entirely red ie ureo colonies after three days of incubation at 30c to test the ability of overexpressed sis1 to block ydj1 or hsp104 mediated curing of ure3 strain one thousand and seventyfive was cotransformed with various combinations of cen plasmids expressing sis1 ydj1 or hsp104 under the control of the gpd promoter

throughout this paper we shall use to index snps to index gwas data sets and to index the annotation data sets we first consider the simplest case where we only have summary statistics pvalues from just one gwas data set and then extend our model to handle multiple gwas data sets and annotation data suppose we have performed hypothesis testing of genomewide snps and obtained their pvalues 3where is the number of snps consider the twogroups model 46 ie the obtained pvalues are assumed to come from the mixture of null and nonnull with probability and  respectively let be the latent variables indicating whether the jth snp is null or nonnull where   and  because a snp can only be either null or nonnull here means unassociated null and means associated nonnull then we have the following twogroups model 4where the pvalues from the null group are from the uniform distribution on 01 denoted as  and the pvalues from the nonnull group are from the beta distribution with parameters  where  we put the constraint to model that a smaller pvalue is more likely than a larger pvalue when it is from the nonnull group 47
 
to incorporate information from functional annotation data we extend the basic model as follows suppose we have collected information from functional annotation sources in the annotation matrix  where indicates whether the jth snp is annotated in the dth functional annotation source for example when there are two annotation sources  eqtl data and dnase i hypersensitivity sites dhs data  then is an matrix if the jth snp is an eqtl then  otherwise  if it is located in a dhs then  otherwise  now we model the relationship between and as 5clearly can be interpreted as the proportion of null snps being annotated in the dth annotation and corresponds to the proportion of nonnull snps being annotated in the dth annotation therefore implies that there exists enrichment for the dth annotation the statistical inference about enrichment of annotation data will be discussed in details in section hypothesis testing of annotation enrichment and pleiotropy
 
now we extend the above model to handle multiple gwas data sets to keep the notation uncluttered we present the model for the case of two gwas data sets suppose we have pvalues from two gwas 6let be the matrix collecting all the pvalues where denotes the pvalue of the jth snp in the kth gwas similarly we introduce latent variables indicating the association between the jth snp and the two phenotypes means the jth snp is associated with neither of them means it is only associated with the first one means it is only associated with the second one and means it is associated with both the twogroups model 4 is extended to the following fourgroups model 7where  when the genetic bases of the two phenotypes are independent of each other ie no pleiotropy then we have by expectation therefore the difference between and can be used to characterize pleiotropy statistical inference on pleiotropy is given in section hypothesis testing of annotation enrichment and pleiotropy
 
to incorporate annotation information into the multiple gwas model 7 similarly we model the relationship between and as 8where is the probability of a null snp being annotated is the probability of the first phenotype associatedsnp being annotated is the probability of the second phenotype associatedsnp being annotated and is the probability of jointly associatedsnp being annotated assuming the independence of snp markers the joint distribution can be written as 9where and are the jth row of and  the second equation holds by assuming the independence between and  conditional on  and the third equation holds by further assuming the independence between and for  conditional on 
 
parameters in the gpa model can be estimated using the expectationmaximization em algorithm 48 which is computationally efficient because we have explicit solutions for estimation of all the parameters in the mstep standard errors for parameter estimates can be approximated using the empirical observed information matrix 49 note that in the gpa model the sample size for estimating the empirical observed information matrix corresponds to the number of snps and as a result we have a very large sample size  to estimate standard errors accurately more details of the em algorithm and the estimation of standard errors are provided in sections one and three in text s1
 
after we estimate the parameters in the gpa model snps can be prioritized based on their local false discovery rates 50 note that separate analysis of single gwas data based on their summary statistics is equivalent to the analysis of single gwas data using gpa without any annotation data hence separate analysis of single gwas data can be considered as a special case of our gpa approach
 
to present the local false discovery rate based on our gpa model we begin with the simplest case single gwas without annotation data in this case there are only two groups null and nonnull the false discovery rate is defined as the probability that the jth snp belongs to the null group given its pvalue ie 10for joint analysis of two gwas data sets we are interested in the local false discovery rate of the jth snp if it is claimed to be associated with the first phenotype the second one and both ie 11similarly when annotation data are available the false discovery rates can be calculated as 12then we use the direct posterior probability approach 51 to control global false discovery rates more details for the estimation of false discovery rates are provided in section two in text s1
 
given an annotation file we may be interested in whether there is statistical evidence for enrichment of gwas signals in this annotation file we propose to use the likelihood ratio test lrt to assess the statistical significance to keep the notation simple we drop the index of annotation files specifically the significance of enrichment of an annotation for singlegwas data analysis can be assessed by the following test 13the lrt statistic is where collects the parameter estimates obtained under  and the superscript a indicates the annotation enrichment test note that can be easily obtained by running the gpa algorithm without incorporating the annotation data under the null the test statistic asymptotically follows the distribution with one degree of freedom 52 we reject if  where is the th quantile of distribution with 
 
for joint analysis of two gwas with annotation data test 13 becomes 14under the null the test statistic asymptotically follows a distribution with  similarly the test of annotation enrichment can be extended to handle gwas in this case the test statistic asymptotically follows distribution with under the null
 
now we consider testing pleiotropy between two gwas when there is no pleiotropy ie the signals from the two gwas are independent of each other testing pleiotropy can be formulated by testing the following hypothesis 15where and  the lrt statistic is constructed as follows where represents the parameter estimates obtained under  and the superscript p indicates the pleiotropy test the test statistic  asymptotically follows distribution with under the null

strains were acquired as desiccated cells from the american type culture collection atcc in manassas virginia usa the leibniz institute dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures dsm in braunschweig germany and the japan collection of microorganisms jcm in ibaraki japan as indicated in table s2 cells were rehydrated in recommended media according to culture collection center protocols and grown to stationary phase at 37c in liquid culture genomic dna was harvested with wizard genomic dna purification kit promega
 
sequence libraries were constructed using a combination of standard fragmentation 200500 bp matepair fragmentation 6 kbp and pcrfree transposonmediated insertion of sequencing primers epicentre nextera 81 transposase was purified from e coli bl21 de3 containing the cloning vector pwh1891 for matepair libraries six kb pairend libraries were constructed and the terminal fifty bases of each end were sequenced according to standard protocols additional libraries were constructed by combining dna fragments from haloarchaeal species distantly enough related to enable unambiguous assignment of nonbarcoded reads soup all sequencing was performed on illumina hiseq and gaii platforms the pairedend information and trimming information were specified using annotation strings on the description line of the reads reads were assembled using the a5 pipeline 18 following assembly genomic dna contamination arising from transposemediated library preparation was removed by searching assembled reads against a local blast database consisting of e coli bl21 de3 genomic dna and the cloning vector pwh1891 blast hits with an evalue  1020 were considered to be significant matches and candidates for contamination contigs with matches covering 80 of the contig length and contigs 1 kbp with matches covering any portion of the contig were treated as contamination and discarded from further analysis long contigs for which only a small portion of the contig matched to the local blast database were also discarded if there were either no annotated features or if the annotated features were e coli genes these criteria resulted in a total of four hundred and ninetyseven contigs equaling two hundred and sixtyfive point five seven kbp being removed from the final assemblies
 
a dual annotation pipeline was implemented in order to take advantage of the strengths of different existing automated annotation tools assembled genomes were first submitted to the rapid annotation using subsystem technology rast server at the national microbial pathogen data resource rastbased gene calls and annotations were used for building of protein families core genome and pan genome analyses phylogenetic reconstruction analysis of general transcription factor expansions gcbias analysis building of molecular marker sets and phylogenetically informed reannotation these annotations can be accessed as a loadable popular genome set through the genome context viewer jcontextexplorer 17 as well as a custom mysql database see text s1 for instructions the rast annotation system was particularly useful in enabling comparison of our genomes with previously sequenced haloarchaea by allowing standardization via rapid reannotation of existing genomes
 
in addition the newly sequenced genomes were annotated using ncbis prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline pgaap 14 pgaap gene calls and annotations were used for cog analysis proteome acidification calculations and generabased genomic feature comparisons these annotations can be accessed through the ncbi website using the accession numbers listed in table s2 as well as through our custom mysql database
 
a phylogeny was constructed for all archaeal genomes available through the integrated microbial genomes database along with our sequenced haloarchaea using a concatenated set of forty conserved marker genes 20 peptide sequences were downloaded for all archaeal genomes from the img four point zero database on january 4 two thousand and thirteen point hmm profiles of forty bacterial and archaeal phyeco markers were searched against these peptide sequences we excluded genomes with less than thirtyfive of these markers as well as duplicate genomes which were included in both our analysis and the img database a total of one hundred and fiftyone img archaeal genomes and all eighty haloarchaeal genomes were included in the phylogenetic tree building for each phyeco marker family only singlecopy members from the genomes were included independent alignments were built using muscle 82 for each gene families and then concatenated a phylogenetic tree was built from the concatenated alignment using phyml three point zero 83 with the lg substitution model tree topology and branch lengths were optimized by the program and alrt shlike statistics was used for branch support estimation the r package ape was used to remove duplicate genomes 84 and the final tree was visualized using figtree 85 the tree files are available as dataset s3 all archaea and dataset s11 haloarchaea only
 
homologous protein families were constructed using a markov clusteringbased approach first an allvsall blastp search of all protein coding genes called by rast in the eighty haloarchaeal genomes was conducted using an evalue cutoff of 105 soft masking and the smithwaterman alignment algorithm these options have been shown to improve homolog detection over other blast methods 86 to enable detection of large homology groups the number of returned matches was set at 100000 to remove spurious domainlevel matches blast results were postfiltered and matches retained only if bidirectional querymatch coverage was 80 and each sequence was 75 of the length of the other matches with evalues1010 were also excluded at this stage text s2
 
blast results were then clustered into homology groups using the clustering algorithm tribemcl 16 which utilizes the proteinprotein similarity network implicit in the blast scores this method has the benefit of building inclusive homology families including orthologs xenologs and both in and outparalogs unlike reciprocal best blast methods which often overlook complex gene relationships in the search for onetoone ortholog mapping to determine an appropriate inflation parameter for tribemcl clustering homology clusters derived from inflation parameters ranging from one point four to eight point zero were compared and benchmarked using manually curated protein families for haloarchaeal tatabinding proteins and opsins the inflation parameter i  two point five was selected as it most closely recapitulated known orthologparalog relationships for the selected protein families a total of 17591 homology clusters protein families were obtained with this method comprising 276364 of 303129 total haloarchaeal proteins the remaining proteins were singletons lacking significant sequence similarity to other sequences in the dataset these sequences may represent speciesspecific innovation recent gene influx from horizontal gene transfer or simply a lack of sequencing depth along some sampled haloarchaeal lineages
 
random subsets of haloarchaeal genomes ranging from zero to eight genomes were selected from the set of rastannotated haloarchaea using the java samplers package 87 for each selection the following quantities were tabulated 1 the number of unique cogs 2 the number of unique tribemcl determined homology clusters and 3 the number of unique nonsingleton tribemcl determined homology clusters ten thousand random selections were performed for each sample size and the average number of unique protein families obtained for each sample were plotted in microsoft excel figure 3
 
the 1479 protein families used in the analysis described in 25 were obtained from the authors all genes were renamed with an e a or h tag prepended to their original ncbi gene id number according to their taxonomic classification as respectively eubacteria archaea or haloarchaea proteins from sixtyfive haloarchaeal species not included in the original study were assembled into a set of additional haloarchaeal proteins and named with an h tag and unique id number five haloarchaeal genomes in our set were either different strains of a species included in the original study or a resequencing of the same strain and so were excluded from reanalysis gene trees were reconstructed for all 1479 of the original protein families using the alignment program mafft 88 with command line options legacygappenalty anysymbol and quiet the protein model determination tool prottest 89 using command line options allmatrices alldistributions s two f t1 and the gene tree creation tool phyml 83 all command line options were obtained from the authors of 25 gene trees were determined to be single transfers from the bacteria only if 1 all haloarchaeal homologs formed a monophyletic group and 2 this monophyletic group rooted with bacterial rather than archaeal homologs for gene trees matching these criteria corresponding protein families were extended to include homologs predicted from the set of additional haloarchaeal proteins using blast with an evalue cutoff of 1010 and a minimum percent identity of 30 gene trees were generated for these extended protein families using the parameters described above extended gene trees were reevaluated according to the criteria described above to determine whether they could still be classified as single bacterial transfers some 172 of the extended protein families contained a sufficiently large number of members such that determination of gene trees was infeasible and so were excluded from reanalysis gene tree classification results are provided in table one point phylogenetic trees visualized in figures s4 and s3 were made using phyfi 90
 
a list of seventyfour genes involved in ion transport and compatible solute transport or synthesis was compiled representative protein sequences for each of the selected genes were obtained by searching the ncbi protein database by annotation dataset s12 when available sequences from the model organisms escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis were selected genes with mm prefix derive from methanosarcina mazei go1 blastp searches for these query sequences were conducted against a local blast database containing eighty haloarchaeal genomes in order to obtain all potential homologs the maximum target sequences parameter was set to 100000 and an evalue cutoff of one was used resulting matches were then filtered using custom perl scripts to remove spurious domainlevel matches by requiring a bidirectional querytarget coverage of 80 and a bidirectional querytarget length of 75 to reduce the number of nonspecific familylevel matches for example to differentiate between the closely related trk hk and ktr nak symporters sequences were also filtered to remove matches with an evalue of1e20 a presenceabsence matrix was constructed from these filtered blast results using custom bash and r scripts and visualized in itol 91 92 genes were grouped into functional categories based on substrate specificity and directionality for ion transporters substrate imported for compatible solute transporters or product for compatible solute biosynthesis proteins as twenty of the query genes were not detected in the set of investigated species only fiftyfour columns appear in figure s5 gene presenceabsence data was scaffold on the multimarker concatenated haloarchaeal phylogeny dataset s11
 
wholegenome feature data for the fiftynine newly sequenced pgaapannotated haloarchaea were retrieved from an inhouse mysql database using custom scripts 67 for each organism the genome size number of contigs percent gc content percent coding number of coding regions and number of insertion sequence elements were extracted genomes were organized into genera and box plots for each of the above traits were drawn for each genus using matlabs statistics toolbox 93 images were exported using the supplementary exportfig function 94 see figure s23
 
all isoelectric point analyses were carried out exclusively on the pgaap gene call set the pi of every protein coding sequence was computationally predicted using the protein sequence isoelectric point prediction method included in the biojava framework 95 pi histograms for each genome were computed using matlabs statistics toolbox 93 sorting proteins into one hundred equally spaced bins ranging from a pi of two point zero to 130 all proteins with a pi of seven point five or greater were collected and a list of all represented gene annotations was procured for each gene annotation in this list all instances were tabulated including the number of instances with a pi greater than or equal to 75 a table showing these results sorted by frequency of instances with high pi can be found in table s5 all proteins annotated as ribosomal subunits were collected and all subunits which could confidently be mapped to experimentally characterized structures for the large 1qvg 96 and small 1fka 97 ribosomal subunits were mapped subunits with a pi75 in 60 or more of cases were colored red and subunits with a pi75 in 60 or more of cases were colored blue any subunits which could not be confidently mapped or which had variable pi across species were left the default color of green all mappings were done using the pymol protein visualization program 98
 
comparative acidification visualizations of tbp and ribosome elongation factor 1 proteins for haloarchaea and nonhalophilic organisms were generated using the swissmodel web interface 99 and 1d3u 100 and 3vmf 101 as the structural templates respectively
 
to investigate localized variations in gc content across each genome custom scripts were created text s3  s4 first gc was calculated for one hundred bp windows across the genome with a twenty bp step size the terminal 100 bps of each contig were not included in calculation so as not to artificially inflate the final gc calculation for each contig windows with10 ambiguous nucleotides were assumed to have gc equal to the contig mean plots were generated showing a the overall mean gc percent for the entire genome as a horizontal green line b the contig boundaries as vertical red lines c the mean gc percent for each contig as horizontal blue lines and d all gc percentages for individual one hundred bp segments as a black line 67 steps where the mean gc inflects away from the local mean were calculated using the r changepoint package 102 and these changepoints were plotted over the stepwise gc percentages as vertical green lines 67 after manual curation of changepoints for each species annotated features between changepoints were retrieved from each species general feature format gff file ten species were excluded from this analysis either due to having a very large number of contigs or having no observable inflections in local mean gc content for a list of excluded organisms and reasons see text s1 the set of features extracted from regions of abnormal gc content were analyzed for enrichment of homologous protein families tribemcl clusters the frequency of each protein family in the abnormal gc feature set was compared to its frequency in the entire genome set and families with at least eightfold enrichment were investigated further to avoid including families which were enriched artificially by having a small number of members which are all present in abnormal gc regions families with fewer than five members were excluded from enrichment analysis
 
a local blast database was constructed using rastderived gene calls for the eighty haloarchaea this database and the ncbi nonredundant protein database as of october 30th 2012 were queried for homologs to the archaeal and eukaryotic general transcription factors tatabinding protein tbp and transcription factor biib tfb using a query set of nineteen curated tbp homologs and twentyseven curated tfb homologs from six archaeal and one eukaryotic species datasets s18  s19 a blastp search was conducted blast2227 using a maximum expect value of 105 and maximum target sequence of 100000 for each set of homologs a multisequence alignment was constructed using muscle v3831 82 and manually curated to remove poorly aligning regions highly divergent and fragmentary sequences were manually removed one thousand bootstrapped alignments were created by resampling the curated alignment using seqboot in the phylip toolkit v369 103 phylogenetic trees were created for each bootstrapped alignment using fasttree v215 sse3 104 and a consensus tree was produced by comparing these trees to a guide tree also constructed using fasttree using the tree comparison tool comparetobootstrappl 105 for all clades in the guide tree the fraction of bootstrapped trees in which that clade appeared were tabulated and recorded as the bootstrap support values for that clade because this approach is limited in that only clades appearing in the initial guide tree are considered we also constructed a consensus tree with the consense program in the phylip package 105 using the extended majority rule option each clade in the resulting consensus tree represents the most frequent grouping of those species in the one thousand bootstrap replicate trees independent of any guide tree for consense tree files see datasets s20s23 branch lengths and node labels in consense tree represent the number of bootstrapped tree replicates for which each clade was observed rather than sequence divergence trees were visualized in figtree 85
 
marker genes were identified by the following procedure homology clusters were identified that were 1 universal to the genus of interest 2 not found in any other haloarchaeal species and 3 single copy homologs were aligned using muscle 82 with default parameters and a hidden markov model was generated from each alignment using hmmer 106 with default parameters additionally a list of marker homology clusters was generated as were the genomic coordinates for each marker gene 67 this list may be loaded into jcontextexplorer 17 as a custom context set
 
putative missed gene calls were identified using jcontextexplorer 17 with the haloarchaea genome set loaded to retrieve the context surrounding tribe4688 with gene calls in twelve haloferax species a between context set was created with a five kbp limit and the query 966 458 was carried out under cluster search regions were visualized by selecting all instances and pushing the view contexts button this produced a set of either two or three gene groupings in the order tribe458 always  tribe4688 sometimes  tribe966 always the sequence between instances of tribe458 and tribe966 in the three haloferax species that did not contain an instance of tribe4688 was extracted and every contiguous region of one hundred and seventeen nucleotides was translated into a protein using matlabs bioinformatics toolbox 107 each match was manually compared to the gene members of protein sequences of tribe4688 and three matches were identified one in each of the three organisms lacking an instance of tribe4688 haloferax alexandrinus hfx elongans and hfx sulfurifontis the sequence alignments were visualized with amino acids colored according to the properties of their side chains to retrieve the region of poor gene call consistency in haloarcula the same between context set was used with a five kbp limit with the query 254 369 under cluster search genomic segments were visualized by selecting all instances and pushing the view contexts button
 
a presenceabsence matrix was constructed for each tribemcl protein family across the eighty haloarchaea and transformed into a distance matrix using euclidean distances hierarchical clustering of this distance matrix was performed using mev 108 and the resulting matrix was visualized groups of protein families which clustered together have a similar phylogenetic dispersal pattern and may therefore perform functionally related tasks this distribution was manually interrogated to find groups of clustered protein families with functionally related annotations unannotated protein families in that cluster were then hypothesized to also be involved in that task

forwardregression genomewide association was then performed with the namgwasplugin in tassel version 4132 46 this plugin was created specifically to run stepwise forward regression on the maize nam population and takes as input the chromosomespecific residuals a genetic map anchor genotypes in the progeny and founder genotypes to be imputed each chromosome was analyzed separately for each phenotype via one hundred forwardregression iterations each of which excluded a random 20 of nam lines to destabilize spurious associations 47 the cutoff for polymorphism inclusion in the model was a raw pvalue 950108 which was empirically determined by permutation testing with the days to anthesis phenotype to correspond to a genomewide type i error rate of 001 the resample model inclusion probability rmip 47 of each polymorphism was determined as the proportion of iterations in which a specific polymorphism was called as significant only polymorphisms with an rmip 005 are considered in this study
 
the input snps were a union of all snps in hapmap1 and hapmap2 a small portion of snps are duplicated between the datasetsthat is they were independently discovered in both studiesbut in almost every case they have different and sometimes conflicting allele calls thus we made no attempt to merge such snps and instead let each original call be tested individually after running gwas we found a single case of ambiguity in determining which snp had been chosen by the model due to two snps having identical positions and allele codings in this case we retained both to maintain consistency with the input dataset
 
putative cnvs were determined by two methods first hapmap2 sequencing reads aligned to the maize genome were counted in two kbwindows and compared to a highcoverage b73 sample with edger 48 this procedure had been done previously 21 and our analysis was primarily to update the results to a newer version of the zea mays reference genome agpv2 the b73 sample from hapmap2 itself served as the null distribution to determine the cutoff corresponding to an empirical genomewide type i error rate of 005 cnvs that had been previously identified within annotated genes by the same method 21 were also included in the analysis but with updated gene coordinates based on their stable ensembl gene identifiers
 
independently the mapped reads were also analyzed by cnvnator 49 to identify putative cnvs based on shifts in mean read depth across five hundred bp bins interestingly although many cnvnator cnvs showed consistent segregation across the nam founders gwas hits came almost exclusively from the edgerderived cnvs looking at the characteristics of each this disparity is probably due to two factors 1 the edgerderived cnvs are generally much smaller than those found by cnvnator and smaller cnvs have previously been shown to have more significant gwas hits in this population 21 and 2 edger also detects many more cnvs than cnvnator to begin with presumably because small cnvs are more common than large ones
 
since there were a total of three separate sources of cnvs in this analysis a single genome region could potentially contribute to multiple cnvs and thus be tested multiple times per gwas run the contribution to each set of cnvs will be different however since each one depends on all regions within its limits and is then collapsed to a single score of zero or one point
 
putative snp effects were determined by running all twentyeight point nine million snps through the ensembl variant effect predictor vep 23 using a local copy of the zea mays ensembl database version 68 since the vep annotates effects relative to any gene model not just qualityfiltered ones it was run with both the mostsevere and pergene options to get lists of the worst overall effect per snp and the worst per gene respectively note that the vep considers that changing an existing amino acid is more severe than inframe insertions and deletions so small indels that do both get classified as missense these make up 01 of the input polymorphisms and only three gwashit ones however so altering the annotation would not significantly affect the results the two results were then combined with inhouse perl scripts to create a list of the worst overall snp effect with respect to only those genes in the zea mays 5b60 filtered gene set available at 
 
polymorphisms classes were tallied for both the input snps dataset and for the gwashit snps using the input dataset as the null we then removed any categories with 5 expected counts in the gwas dataset total counts in the remaining groups were then tested for significance by a chisquare test using the stats package in r 50 individual categories were then tested for enrichment by a twosided exact binomial test also in r
 
due to the possibility that linkage disequilibrium could distort the results from the above test we also ran one million circular permutations of the hits to generate a null distribution of what would be expected by chance circular permutation in this case refers to keeping the order of all elements intact while randomly changing the start location along the chromosome this maintains the structure of the original data while randomizing its relationship to genomic features the resulting counts formed a normal distribution which was used to extrapolate the pvalues in s1 table
 
marginal variance explained by polymorphisms classes genic geneproximal intergenic and cnvs was calculated by fitting linear models to each trait and comparing the difference in variance explained adjusted r2 between a model with all identified snps and a model with all snps except those in the chosen category
 
standardized effect sizes for each polymorphism were determined by first taking all effect sizes the namgwas model identified for each trait and fitting an empirical cumulative distribution function with ecdf in r 50 this function was then used to determine the quantile of each effect mean quantile scores were then calculated for each polymorphism that passed rmip005 filtering each point in the distribution thus represents a specific traitpolymorphism combination
 
gene ontology term analysis was performed with agrigo 51 using all genes with gwas hits within five kb of their annotated transcript statistical analysis was performed in r 50 via a twosided fishers exact test with benjaminiyekutieli control of the false discovery rate fdr to analyze for both enrichment and depletion
 
maize paralogs were taken from an existing list 52 available at  the number of genes with paralogs in the gwas hit dataset was compared to those in the maize filtered gene set and significance of the difference tested by a twosided exact binomial test in r 50

ecoli ru1 hence forth referred to as e coli and c freundii ru2 hence forth referred to as c freundii were isolated from the stool of healthy humans s1 text s5 figure to minimize any potential for adaptation during the isolation process we plated stool samples on macconkey agar plates after a single overnight growth half of a single colony was flash frozen at 80c in trypticase soy broth with 20 glycerol bd usa and the other half was used for phenotypic strain characterization strain identification by 16s sequencing was done from the frozen sample all experimental evolution studies started from the frozen primary isolates by using a single clonalized colony derived from the initial snap frozen isolate the identity of the wild unadapted strains was based on the results of api twenty e biomerieux usa test strips and speciesspecific pcr using forward primer agagtttgatcmtggctcag reverse primer gwattaccgcggckgctg
 
twelve clones of e coli ru1 were evolved independently for two hundred days by daily transfers of a single randomly chosen colony to a fresh lb plate fig 1 every fifteen days a sample of the transferred colony was frozen at 80c to calculate the generations per transfer we assessed the number of cells in a colony after twentyfour hours of growth on lb agar and calculated the number of doublings as log2number of cellscolony at generation 0 one hundred and five and two hundred for two randomly chosen lines the average number of generations per transfer was calculated as 294 which results in five thousand eight hundred and eightyeight generations over two hundred single cell bottlenecks
 
a single colony from the frozen cultures of e coli ru1 and c freundii ru2 were each used to inoculate twelve independent cultures in luria broth miller lb bd and brainheart infusion bbl bhi bd fig 1 s3 table populations evolved in liquid media were transferred as described previously 10 11 lbevolved populations were grown in ten ml liquid lb miller broth in 25mm test tubes at two hundred and fifty rpm and 37c and transferred daily by 100fold dilutions into fresh media 66 generationsday for a total of seventyfive days or five hundred generations every fifteen days we froze a sample of the populations at 80c for further analyses the bhievolved populations were cultured in ten ml of bhi broth under the same conditions as the lb cultures but transferred daily by 40000fold dilutions into fresh media 152 generationday for a total of fifty days or seven hundred and sixtyfive generations this dilution was chosen to achieve the same effective population size at transfer of one hundred and five cellsml as in a parallel experiment performed with yersinia pestis to allow direct comparisons the bhievolved populations were frozen at 80c after twentyfive and fifty days
 
assays were performed either at the population level or the single colony level cells or populations were grown in their selective media lb or bhi and grown in liquid media or plated on agar plates made with their selective media unless otherwise stated adaptation to the selective environments was assessed as changes in lag time and growth rate by measuring od600 over twentyfour hours of growth in liquid media following walkiewicz et al 74 to test for changes in the ph of spent media we grew the populations to stationary phase and measured the ph of the media after removing the cells to test for genetic variation within the populations we plated the populations at low density on tetrazolium arabinose plates and observed considerable variation in both colony size and in the ability to utilize arabinose we plated the populations on the selective media supplemented with agar and isolated eight randomly chosen colonies from each of the twelve populations per treatment these test sets of ninetysix individual isolates per species and environment were used for three phenotypic assays 1 the redox state by plating on methylene blue 0065 gliter 2 differences in exopolysaccharides by plating on congo red 015 gliter and 3 loss of motility by plating cells on soft agar 025 difco for more information see s1 text
 
genomic dna of the two ancestral strains was isolated using the ultra clean microbial dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc and sequenced on the roche four hundred and fiftyfour platform according to standard sequencing methods the reference sequences of e coli ru1 and c freundii ru2 were assembled de novo using newbler v26 and annotated using rast 80 the annotated genes were grouped by function and assigned to subsystems using seed 81 s6 figure
 
genomic dna of single clones ma lines ma1ma12 and whole populations lb1lb12 lb25lb36 and bhi1bhi24 was isolated as described for the ancestors and sequenced on illumina hiseq in one hundred bp pairedend reads reads were aligned to the reference sequence using the breseq024rc6 pipeline with options j2 c p82 mutations that occurred at a minimum frequency of 005 which is an order of magnitude above the overall error rate as determined following saxer et al 44 were considered because we used such a low acceptance threshold for mutations in polymorphic populations we used additional measures to reduce the false positive rate that can be due to errors in the reference sequence duplications that were incorrectly resolved in the reference sequence repeat regions or sequence properties or methylation patterns 83 mutations arise at random and under a model of selective neutrality the frequency of a mutation should be proportional to the time it arose while the frequency of a beneficial mutation should be determined by the time it arose and by its selection coefficient therefore mutations that arise at random cannot be expected to occur at almost the same frequency in replicated polymorphic populations in clonal samples polymorphic sites could arise when a single colony is grown to high density for dna isolation however such mutations should be rare within a single sample and very unlikely to occur in multiple independent clonal samples in addition the relaxed selection experience by the ma lines makes it unlikely that the same mutation would arise in multiple independently evolved lines while beneficial mutations can evolve more than once in mutation accumulation experiments it is unlikely that such mutations would occur at the exact same site nucleotide at approximately the same frequencies in independently evolved mutation accumulation lines and that these same mutations would be polymorphic in a clonal sample ie at lower frequency than 0809 among reads aligning to that site
 
we aligned the reads of the clonal ma lines as if they were polymorphic populations and identified mutations that occurred in four or more lines these sites were removed from bhi and lbevolved populations we performed the same removal procedure for mutations that occurred in one to twelve ma lines and observed a significant change in the number of mutations removed based on their presence in three or four ma lines this resulted in the removal of two hundred and thirtythree mutations that occurred in three treatments lb bhi and ma seventytwo mutations that occurred in two treatments ma and lb or ma and bhi and three mutations that occurred in the ma lines the majority of these mutations were in intergenic regions in transposable elements hypothetical genes and in the large and small ribosomal subunits in addition we removed mutations in genes encoding for genes annotated as core proteins the magnesium and cobalt transport protein cora and trna dihydrouridine synthase a
 
based on our experience with e coli and the work of lang et al 84 we used a different approach to filter out false positive mutations for c freundii adaptive mutations that arise in multiple populations evolve at different times and in populations with a different assortment of genotypes which is reflected in different frequencies in the populations the frequencies of false positive mutations that are a result of systematic errors on the other hand will be very similar among populations therefore we filtered out any site for which the frequencies in bhi and lb did not significantly differ based on levenes test 85

all strains used in this study are listed in table one point strain gry2691 a mat a parent table 1 was constructed by transformation of gry1600 with a pvuii fragment from plasmid pmush22 14 containing can1 and his3 genes transcribing away from one another fig 1a resulting in an insertion of the three point eight kb cassette one point eight five kb proximal to the mat locus the sequences of can1 present in the cassette are from 148 to 1973 relative to the can1 start codon the strain also harbors a deletion of can1 that excludes sequences from 151 to 1995 relative to the atg thus there is no homology present between the two loci the his3 insertion includes sequences from 191 to 857 of the his3 orf the his3200 mutation extends from 205 to 835 thus there are only twentytwo bp of homology on the 3 end of his3 and no homology on the 5 end the mat parent gry2690 table 1 fig 1b was constructed by insertion of a natmx cassette from pag25 58 between fen1 and snm1 on chromosome iii and selection on nourseothricin clonnat werner bioagents essentially as described for creating the yeast knockout libraries by providing fortyfive bp of homology on either side of the cassette to the target locus 59 the kanmx cassette was inserted into gry2690 by pcr of yihkanmx from the yeast mata knockout collection strain open biosystems with an additional 250 bp flanking homology and selection on g418 genticin us biologicals to construct the promotorless can1 gene fig one c we replaced his3 the can1 promoter and the first six amino acids of the can1 orf of pmush22 with a leu2 marker by recombineering 60 with a pcr fragment of leu2 containing thirtyfive bp of flanking homology to either side of the his3 gene once the construct was verified and sequenced it was inserted into strain gry2690 by one step transplacement 61 hotspot constructs were made by pcr of the his3 can1 and the leu2 can1 cassettes with 5 end tailed primers containing fifty bp homology on either side to a site between are1 and bud23 the are1 and bud23 genes are transcribed away from one another the insertion did not delete any base pairs and was positioned so that it was between 333 of bud23 and 147 of are1
 
strains deleted for spo11 and spo13 were constructed by pcr of the appropriate gene disruption from the yeast knockout collection 44 and subsequent transformation into strains gry2690 and gry2691 followed by selection on g418 as described 59 disruptions were confirmed by pcr southern blot and phenotypic analysis where possible strains deleted for rev3 were obtained by onestep transplacement of an xba1 fragment containing a rev3leu2 disruption from plasmid pam56 kindly provided by alan morrison transformants were selected on media lacking leucine and further confirmed by pcr and a reduced level of uv induced papillation to canavanine resistance for strains carrying the his3can1 cassette strains deleted for sae2 were pcr amplified from a sae2hygmx mutant strain which was constructed by marker replacement of the knockout collection 44 58
 
tetrads were isolated by patching the various diploid strains on yepd then growing up a five ml culture in amar spore media for a minimum of five days tetrads were treated with zymolyase and dissected onto yepd after growth on yepd the tetrads were examined for each of the relevant markers by replica plating genetic distance was calculated using the perkins equation cm  100x  100 6nt2pnt 62
 
to analyze the rate of the mutations occurring during mitotic cell divisions we used a luriadelbruck fluctuation test 63 performed as follows the relevant haploid strains were mated and zygotes were isolated by micromanipulation on yepd individual zygote colonies were struck for single cells on yepd nine colonies from each independent zygote colony were inoculated into five ml of yepd cells were shaken at 30 overnight and then diluted 150 into ten ml fresh yepd and incubated for 46 hours at 30 to midlog phase 24107 cellsml with shaking for the spo13 diploids we grew one hundred ml of culture after washing cultures in sterile water half of the cells were removed and used to determine the number of his cells and the number of his canr mutants from each culture the remaining diploid cells were then resuspended into five ml sporulation media and incubated at 30 with shaking until 90 of the cells had sporulated by microscopic examination 5 days mutation rates during mitosis were estimated by the masandrisarkar maximum likelihood method 64 this is a recursive algorithm that is the product of the probabilities pr for the experimental results r the number of mutants per culture m is the number of mutations per culture and c is the number of cultures the proportion of cultures with no mutations is  and cultures with 12i mutations are calculated by  the recursive function works as follows to find the best estimate of m from the fluctuation analysis the mutation frequencies his canrhis ranged from 1105 to 1108 with majority of cultures falling in the 25107 range to determine the 95 confidence intervals we used the following equations and from foster 65
 
for determination of mutation rates during meiosis we used a random spore analysis as described 66 briefly the ascospores were washed twice in five ml water and then resuspended in five ml water with zero point two five ml one mgml zymolyase100t and ten l 2me cells were incubated overnight at 30c with gentle shaking five ml 15 np40 roche  11754599001 was added along with two ml acid washed glass beads and incubated on a roller drum at room temperature for two hours with occasional vigorous vortexing disruption of spores was monitored microscopically this procedure lyses all unsporulated cells appropriate dilutions were plated onto media to determine the total number of his and his canr cells determination of the meiotic frequencyrate was calculated by subtracting the mitotic frequency from the meiotic frequency for each culture meiotic hiscanrhis per ml minus mitotic hiscanrhis per ml the resulting frequencies were then used to determine a median value reflecting the rate of mutations arising during meiosis since meiosis involves a single division for linkage analysis we selected doubly recessive red ade21 cyhr his canr random spores to maximize analysis of haploid cells versus cells that mated after plating
 
to identify crossovers among the mitotic mutants we patched 200 his canr events onto ypd phenotypically scored the markers and replica plated them to sporulation media after 67 days at 30 spore patches were replica plated to ypd grown overnight and mated to freshly grown strains gry633 and gry634 diploids were selected on media lacking both histidine and uracil because the his3 can1 cassette is located near the mata locus noncrossovers mate with strain gry634 mat and give rise to nats colonies crossovers between natmx and his3 can1 also only mate with strain gry634 mat but form natr progeny finally crossovers between his3 can1 and mat mate with strain gry633 mata resulting in nats colonies double crossovers between the same chromatids of which none were detected would mate with gry633 and become natr no crossovers between his3 and mat were observed among the mitotic diploids analyzed a similar scheme was used to analyze for mitotic crossover events for the strains with the construct in the hotspot except that the kanmx marker was also scored
 
after plating for random spores we colony purified 300600 red his canr cyhr spore clones from each strain onto media lacking histidine these were then retested for canr patched and replica plated to test the relevant markers and determine mating type by crossing with strains dc14 and dc17 approximately fifty of the spore colonies from each strain that presented evidence of a crossover were mated to gry1600 or gry1601 depending on mating type and 510 tetrads were dissected from each to further confirm linkage
 
the entire can1 gene was pcr amplified from mutant candidates and sequenced on both strands three polymorphisms were noted in our can1 gene as compared to the published s288c can1 sequence the sequence of the mutations identified in mitosis or meiosis are listed in supplemental tables s1 and s2 respectively sequencing was done by the laboratory of molecular technologies sequencing facility saicfrederick fnlcr
 
dna isolation and southern blots were carried out as described by sun et al 67 for the hotspot analysis dna was digested with aatii and run on a 07 agarose gel for the coldspot analysis dna was digested with pvuii and run on a 1 agarose gel 32pdctp labeled probes were made with the agilent prime it ii kit according to manufacturers instructions hotspot probe used a pcr fragment spanning coordinates 213283213848 of chromosme iii coldspot probes used a pcr fragment spanning 195735196774 of chromosome iii
 
statistical analyses were calculated by the chi square test for tetrads and random spores in tetrads we compared pd npd and tt between the various strains for random spore analysis we compared the number of crossovers in each interval for each strain for distribution analysis along the length of can1 the gene was divided into two hundred bp windows as described previously 25 for comparison between mutation rates from mitotic growth and from meiosis we used a students t test

trait transformations and adjustment to achieve approximate normality of the traits within each study fg and natural logarithmtransformed fi levels were adjusted for age sex bmi and study specific covariates followed by inverse normalization of the residuals inverse normalized residuals were used as the dependent quantitative trait in genetic association models to calibrate type one error effect estimates were obtained using untransformed fg and natural logarithmtransformed fi levels after adjusting for age sex bmi and study specific covariates
 
the illumina humanexome beadchip array was genotyped by individual studies this custom array was designed to facilitate largescale genotyping of 247870 mostly rare maf05 and lowfrequency maf 055 protein altering variants selected from sequenced exomes and genomes of 12000 individuals see urls details of genotype calling and quality control are presented in s1 table to confirm the genotyping quality of all the variants discussed in the manuscript we compared the genotype calls in 2312 to 4000 individuals for which we have both exomearray genotypes and exomesequence data s8 table the results are highly concordant for all variants 99 heterozygous genotype concordance and 100 concordance observed for nonreference homozygotes call rate and hardyweinberg equilibrium pvalues for each variant are provided in s9 table
 
singlevariant analysis we tested single variants for association with fg and fiderived inverse normalized residuals assuming an additive genetic model using a linear mixed model to account for relatedness with emmax 5 studyspecific qq plots and genomic lambdas are shown in the s3 fig we repeated singlevariant association analyses with untransformed fg and natural logarithmtransformed fi residuals to obtain effect estimates we then combined the association summary statistics across studies by using a fixedeffects metaanalysis sample size zscore weighted using metal 36 genotype cluster plots of all variants described here were inspected visually in all studies
 
singlevariant conditional analysis conditional analysis was performed to identify additional association signals at known or novel loci the analysis included the genotypes of the lead variants at the conditioning loci as covariates in the regression analysis in emmax we then performed metaanalysis of the association summary statistics across studies by using a fixedeffects metaanalysis sample size zscore weighted
 
genebased analysis for genebased testing we first computed singlevariant score statistics and their covariance matrices for all polymorphic markers within each study we then combined the singlevariant score statistics from all studies using the cochranmantelhaenszel method and computed corresponding variancecovariance matrices centrally 6 these variancecovariance matrices were used to compute genelevel statistics we applied a frequencyweighted burden test which assumes variants have similar effect sizes and skat a dispersion test that performs well when both protective and deleterious variants are present 8 9 testspecific asymptotic distributions were used to evaluate significance for genebased analyses we used only unrelated individuals n  32223 for fg and n  29848 for fi and included principal components as covariates to adjust for population structure we generated four variant lists using frequency data and functional annotation variants were mapped to transcripts in ensembl sixtysix grch3766 using annotations from chaos v063 snpeff v31 and vep v27 we identified variants predicted to be proteintruncating ptv eg nonsense frameshift essential splice site or proteinaltering eg missense inframe indel nonessential splice site in at least one mapped transcript by at least one of the three algorithms 37 38 we additionally used the procedure described by purcell et al to identify subsets of missense variants meeting strict or broad criteria for being deleterious using annotation predictions from polyphen2humdiv polyphen2humvar lrt mutationtaster and sift 10 masks one ptvonly and three ptv  nsstrict are restricted to variants with predicted major effect on protein function and as a result disproportionately favor inclusion of rare variants whilst masks two ptv  missense and four ptv  nsbroad are more permissive in total we tested 1028 14465 4603 and 13093 genes having at least two such variants in the above four categories respectively for genebased tests reaching exomewide significance if the conditional analysis showed that the signal was driven by a single variant we required the variant to achieve exomewide significance in the singlevariant test as well

estimating phenotypic variance explained by snps we used a subset of finnish samples find2d 2007 dps drs extra finrisk 2007 and metsim n  10266 to calculate variance explained by g6pc2 we ran a model regressing bmi adjusted fg on the four g6pc2 variants intronic gwas lead snp rs560887 phis177tyr rs138726309 ptyr207ser rs2232323 and pval219leu rs492594 assuming an additive model and adjusting for sex age age2 and study origin a separate model was run excluding the gwas snp to determine the additional variance captured with the three coding variants
 
power calculationswe had 999 power to identify variants that explain 03 of the phenotypic variance and 80 power to detect coding variants that explain 01 of the phenotypic variance to achieve 80 power for variants with maf005 would require effect sizes of at least one sd unit of residuals of mmoll for fg and pmoll for fi
 
when we estimate power to detect association for aggregation tests we make many assumptions i proportion of variants contributing to trait variation ii direction of effects iii number of variants aggregated and iv allele frequency distribution of the variants 34 in this study assuming 100 of the variants contribute to trait variation we had 999 power to detect association for genes that explain 025 of the phenotypic variance and 80 to detect genes that explain 01 of the phenotypic variance using a burden test and 05 of the phenotypic variance using skat in a less favorable scenario for example assuming a gene explains 025 of the phenotypic variance 25 of the variants contribute to trait variation different directions of effect twenty variants tested and variants sampled from the reported allele frequency distribution in the exomearray design power to detect association in this study may be near 0 for a burden test and 63 for skat 34

tr was measured in g3 dams as described above each dam was classified as having trd p  zero point zero five for 1df  two test of null hypothesis tr  05 or not having trd p  005 both g2 parents and g3 dams were genotyped on megamuga and phased haplotypes at r2d2 were inferred by manual inspection of haplotype reconstructions in order to isolate the contribution of maternal and paternal alleles to trd megamuga markers called as h in the g2 dam and homozygous in the g2 sire were retained for mapping and presence of trd was mapped as a binary phenotype using a logistic regression analog to the haleyknott method the procedure was repeated using only markers called as h in the father of the g3 dams and homozygous in the mother significance thresholds for lod scores were obtained by unrestricted permutation
 
crosses 12 710 and 1617 table 1 dna was prepared from spleens of 21day old mice dna extraction and snp genotyping were carried out as described previously 74
 
all other samples dna for pcrbased genotyping was performed on crude whole genomic dna extracted by heating tissue in 100ul of 25mm naoh02mm edta at 95c for sixty minutes followed by the addition of 100ul of 40mm trishcl the samples were then spun at two thousand rpm for ten minutes and the supernatant collected for use as pcr template all primers s6 table used in this study were designed using primerquest software  pcr reactions contained 152 mm mgcl2 02025 mm dntps 0218 m of each primer and 051 units of gotaq polymerase promega in a final volume of 1050 l cycling conditions were 95c two min thirtyfive cycles at 95 55 and 72c for thirty sec each with a final extension at 72c seven min pcr products were loaded into a 2 agarose gel and run at two hundred v for 40120 minutes depending on the marker genotypes were scored and recorded
 
dna for megamuga genotyping was isolated as described previously 4053 briefly 2 mm of mouse tail 5 mg was harvested flashfrozen on dry ice and digested with proteinase k overnight at 65c the following day dna was extracted using the qiagen puregene gentra kit kit no 158389 qiagen gmbh hilden germany genotyping was performed with the megamuga genotyping microarray neogengeneseek lincoln ne a 78000probe array based on the illumina infinium platform
 
genotyping by taqman after r2d2 was established as the causal variant for trd a subset of dog16 progeny and all m16i x l6f2 intercross progeny were genotyped using taqman realtime pcr assays for cwc22 samples heterozygous for a highcopy allele at r2d2 can be readily distinguished from samples homozygous for a lowcopy allele based on the normalized cycle threshold value estimated from the assay see section copynumber validation below
 
deviation from mendelian transmission tr is reported as the ratio of the wsbeij genotype to the total number of genotypes wsb  wsb  nonwsb p values for aggregate data were calculated using a  two goodnessoffit test of the observed number of wsbeij genotypes compared to the number of wsbeij genotypes expected under the null hypothesis of equal transmission x2wsbwsbnonwsb22wsbnonwsb2
 
for individual dams the small sample sizes typically fewer than fifty total offspring would lead to type ii error therefore pvalues were calculated using an exact binomial test confidence intervals for trs were calculated using the binom r package 
 
average litter size average litter size was calculated as the mean number of offspring counted soon after birth per litter per dam  standard deviation including the number of viable embryos counted in utero in midgestation do dams unless otherwise noted
 
the expected average litter size als of a dam under a model in which lethality is the sole explanation for trd is alsobsalsexp12tr12tr where als exp is the mean als in dams with no trd 41 significance of the deviation of als obs from als exp was determined using a wilcox signed rank test
 
inheritance of r2d2 alleles similarly the average absolute number of offspring inheriting each r2d2 allele was calculated as the mean number of offspring per litter per dam having each of the possible genotypes significance was determined using a onetailed student ttest
 
do and f1 dams were euthanized by co2 asphyxiation 1218 days after delivery of the previous litter and the uterus was dissected the number of live embryos and reabsorbed dead embryos was recorded each live embryo was dissected to isolate dna for genotyping tissue from each live embryo was harvested for dna extraction and genotyping
 
all mda arrays were genotyped using mousedivgeno 57 and all megamuga arrays were genotyped using illumina beadstudio we plotted number of h and n calls as a fraction of the total number of genotypes for each group of similar samples and excluded outliers from further analysis for cc lines do animals ccxcc f1 females and doxcc f1 females we inferred haplotypes using probabilistic methods 4075 as an additional qc step we grouped do samples by generation and plotted the number of recombinations counted as unique transitions in haplotype reconstructions and removed outliers
 
casteij allele in the cc g2f1 thirtyfour mda snp probe sets were identified within r2d in the grcm38 reference sequence s3 table we ensured that these probes were unique using blat 76 to map them to the reference genome in order to map the expansion allele present in the casteij strain phenotypes and genotypes were coded as follows first we applied a ccs transform 77 to the mean intensity of all probes in each probe set using mousedivgeno 57 and summed the values for each sample to obtain the final phenotype value next the genome was divided into a set of disjoint intervals whose boundaries were defined by the 21933 unique recombination events inferred in the population 40 so that no individual would be recombinant within any of the resulting intervals then using haplotype reconstructions individuals were coded as either heterozygous castnotcast or homozygous notcastnotcast within each interval there are no cast homozygous individuals in this population of four hundred and seventyfour individuals one hundred and fortyfour with a wsbeij allele in the middle of chromosome two were excluded to yield a final sample size of three hundred and thirty point a singlelocus qtl scan was then performed via haleyknott regression 78 treating the population as a backcross
 
wsbeij allele in an intercross population three megamuga snp probes were identified within r2d in the grcm38 reference s4 table again uniqueness was verified using blat in order to map the expansion allele in wsbeij the sum intensity of these probes was used as a phenotype and genotypes were coded as follows first the genome was divided into a grid of 1000 disjoint intervals of approximately equal size and one megamuga snp marker segregating between wsbeij and pwkphj was selected per interval individuals were coded as heterozygous wsbnotwsb or homozygous notwsbnotwsb at each marker a singlelocus qtl scan was then performed using haleyknott regression as implemented in rqtl 79 treating the population as a backcross
 
in order to refine the location of r2d2 we identified individual mice with recombinant chromosomes within the candidate interval defined by linkage mapping these critical recombinants define the proximal and distal boundaries of the refined candidate interval
 
casteij allele we partitioned the three hundred and thirty g2f1 individuals without a wsbeij allele in the r2d locus into two groups according to mda sumintensity values from those with sumintensity consistent with a noncasteij expansion allele we selected the most distal recombinants from casteij to another haplotype from those with sumintensity consistent with the casteij expansion allele we selected the most distal recombinant from another haplotype to casteij together these recombinants define the proximal boundary of the candidate interval in casteij similarly in order to define the distal boundary of the candidate interval we selected the most proximal recombinants from casteij to another haplotype that still had sumintensity consistent with the casteij expansion allele
 
wsbeij allele the boundaries of the wsbeij candidate interval were mapped in the same fashion using two hundred and twentynine individuals spanning generations ten through fourteen of the do all of which have been genotyped on megamuga and are recombinant for wsbeij in the initial candidate interval we first excluded individuals homozygous for wsbeij over any interval with in the interval then we selected the most distal recombinants from another haplotype to wsbeij which also had megamuga sumintensity values consistent with a nonwsbeij expansion allele these recombinants define the distal boundary of the candidate interval we mapped the proximal boundary similarly
 
spreteij allele c57bl6jxspreteijxc57bl6j n  12 and ajxspreteijxaj progeny n  17 2643 genotyped on the megamuga array were used to refine the candidate interval for the expansion allele in spreteij haplotypes in the relevant region of chr two were inferred by manual inspection of genotype calls samples were partitioned according to sumintensity at the three megamuga snp probes tracking the expansion allele among individuals with sumintensity consistent with the expansion allele the most proximal recombinant from spreteij to another haplotype defines the distal boundary of the candidate interval likewise the most distal recombinant from a nonspreteij haplotype to spreteij defines the proximal boundary of the candidate interval
 
ten individuals from the hr8 selection line were selected for wholegenome sequencing five micrograms of highmolecularweight dna were used to construct truseq illumina libraries using zero point five g starting material with 300 to 400 and 400 to 500bp fragment sizes each library was sequenced on one lane of an illumina hiseq2000 flowcell as pairedend reads with 100bp read lengths we aligned the sequences to the university of california at santa cruz mouse build mm9 hr8 sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse genome mm9 using bowtie 223 80 with default options we removed pcr duplicates and filtered lowquality snps using samtools 0119 81 and picard one point eight eight 
 
we retrieved bam files of aligned reads oct two thousand and twelve release from the sanger mouse genomes project ftp site ftpmousesangeracuk we used the mpileup function of samtools 81 to call sequence variants on the hr8 and sanger bam files jointly and to output the read depth at each base we counted a snp as private to wsbeij spreteij and the ten hr8 individuals if those samples all shared a genotype that was different from the seven other cc founder strains we defined the boundaries of the copy number expansion by identifying consecutive 100bp windows in which the average read depth was at least twice the genomewide average read depth we estimated the number of copies of the expansion as the modal perbase read depth
 
we used commerciallyavailable taqman assays for cwc22 to estimate the copy number of r2d2 we used two copy number assays life technologies catalog numbers mm00644079cn mm00053048cn to target the number of cwc22 copies proximal and distal we also used two reference assays tfrc cat no 4458366 for target mm00053048cn tert cat no 4458368 for target mm00644079cn for genes known to exist in a single haploid copy in the mouse to calibrate the amplification curve assays were performed according to the manufacturers protocol on an abi stepone plus realtime pcr system life technologies carlsbad ca cycle thresholds ct for each assay were determined using the abi copycaller v20 software with default settings for each targetreference pair relative cycle threshold ct was calculated as
 
the ct value is proportional to copynumber of the target gene on the log scale but is subject to batch effects in order to account such effects normalized ct values for each sample were calculated as follows a standard set of control samples from c57bl6j wsbeij casteij and wsbeijxc57bl6jf1 mice spanning the expected copynumber range for cwc22 were included in duplicate or triplicate in every assay batch a linear mixed model was fit to raw ct values for these control samples with targetreference pair and batch as random effects using the lme4 package  for r  predicted values best linear unbiased predictors blups from this model capture technical variation orthogonal to variation due to genotype blups calculated from control samples were subtracted from raw ct values for all samples and the residual was used as the normalized ct for copynumber estimation
 
in this manuscript we chose in most cases to present ct rather than extrapolated absolute copy number because ct is the natural scale of the data ie the log scale constant variance with respect to mean on the log scale grows exponentially on the linear scale so that estimates of absolute copy number become increasingly uncertain as copynumber grows
 
the use of taqman assays for cwc22 as a proxy for copy number at r2d2 was validated by mapping normalized ct for target mm00644079cn as a quantitative phenotype in sixtyfour members of the fvbnjxwsbeijxpwkphjf1g2 intercross population described above the marker selection and mapping procedure were the same as described above for mapping megamuga sumintensity values

three hundred and sixtynine elite breeding lines were selected for genotyping from the international rice research institute irri irrigated rice breeding program based on the planned inclusion of the lines in the two thousand and eleven multienvironment testing program and presence in the two thousand and eleven and two thousand and twelve replicated yield trials ryt at irri los banos approximately half of the lines were also included in the 20092010 ryts at irri s1 table the other lines were promoted from the observational yield trial oyt to the ryt in two thousand and eleven point
 
phenotypes for the replicated yield trials ryt were used for all the experiments and curated from the irri database for years 20092012 including wet and dry seasons each year all of the ryt breeding lines of which our selected three hundred and sixtynine lines are a subset were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replicates in the same field location at irri every season and year the following data were curated for each year with the exception that plant height data was not available for the two thousand and nine wet season plant height the actual measurement in cm from soil surface to tip of tallest panicle awns excludedflowering time days to when 50 of flowers were visible in whole plotmaturity date days to when 85 of grains on panicle were maturenumber of effective tiller or panicle per plant count of the number of panicles on each plantlodging score percent of plants that lodgedgrain yield kgha grain yield from a representative plot was harvested and weighed from this sample the grain yield per hectare was calculated from an inner harvested area of the plot excluding border rowsrep replication number of observation

dna extraction young leaf tissue was collected from each of the three hundred and sixtynine breeding lines from plants grown in gutterman greenhouse in ithaca ny dna was extracted using the qiagen 96plex dneasy kit as per the qiagen fresh leaf tissue 96plex protocol wwwqiagencomhbdneasy96plant
 
library preparation 384plex genotypingbysequencing gbs libraries were prepared using the protocol by elshire et al two thousand and eleven 62 as described previously in spindel and wright et al two thousand and thirteen 63
 
gbs data analysis snps were discovered and called from the raw 384plex gbs data using the tassel30 gbs pipeline with physical alignment to the msu version six point zero nipponbare rice reference genome using bowtie2 as described in spindel and wright et al two thousand and thirteen 476364 s5 fig the irri breeding materials genotyped here are a collection of multiparent related and unrelated inbred lines so the gbsplaid algorithm for imputation which was developed specifically for imputation of biparental rice mapping populations was not useful 63 imputation of missing data was instead performed using the tassel30 fastimputationbitfixedwindow plugin with default settings 48 the algorithm works by dividing the entire snp dataset into small snp windows then identifying the most similar inbred line within each window to fill the missing data the algorithm takes advantage of small ibd regions shared between pairs of inbred lines in the collection if the window from the closest neighbor has more than 5 difference from the line being imputed the data point is left as missing 48 the imputation error rate using this algorithm was estimated for each chromosome in our dataset by masking a fraction of the unimputed allele calls and comparing the imputed and actual calls the average imputation error rate across the twelve rice chromosomes was estimated in this way to be less than 1
 
snps that still had 10 or more data missing after imputation or call rates of  90 were removed from the dataset along with all monomorphic snps for a total snp set of 73147 snps after the snp filtering described above individuals with more than 60 missing data were dropped from the dataset which resulted in the removal of six individuals that failed sequencing for the total of three hundred and sixtythree genotyped lines used throughout the study s5 fig
 
the final dataset was then transformed from nucleotide genotype coding ie a c t g to numeric coding 1 0 1 for class i homozygotes heterozygotes and class ii homozygotes respectively to facilitate statistical analysis the minimal remaining missing data were filled using the numeric genotype means of each line in order to perform pca and genomic selection modeling s5 fig
 
the majority of the three hundred and sixtythree lines were characterized a priori from pedigree records to belong to the indica or indicaadmixed subpopulation groups in order to identify outlier individuals belonging to the japonica or japonicaadmixed groups principle components analysis pca was performed in r version 301 using the imputed 73147 snps with remaining missing data filled using the line means the first principal component of high density snp data in rice can separate the indica and japonica subgroups 30 so by plotting the first four principal components using jmp pro 10 thirteen japonica outliers were identified as a tight cluster that was pulled apart from the rest of the three hundred and fifty lines s1a fig these thirteen lines were removed from the dataset and a second pca was performed using the same methodology as the first to identify any admixed outliers ie outlier lines containing greater percentages of japonica derived snps by plotting the first four principal components of the second pca another eighteen lines were judged on a visual basis to be outliers and removed from the dataset leaving a total of three hundred and thirtytwo lines to be used for the crossvalidation experiments s1b fig a third pca was performed using the remaining three hundred and thirtytwo to confirm that there were no additional subpopulation outliers
 
it was also known from studying the breeding program pedigrees that differing degrees of family relatedness existed within the remaining three hundred and thirtytwo lines including half sibs full sibs parents and offspring and unrelated lines the presence of highly related individuals in the dataset could have the effect of artificially inflating prediction accuracy if the most closely related individuals are randomly assigned to different folds and one of those folds is then used as training while the other is used as testing or in other words the training fold could end up as unusually predictive of the testing fold if for example a pair of full sibs is split across training and testing folds to control for this possibility when designing our folds we performed a partitioning around kmedoids analysis pamk using the r fpc package function pamk with the 73147 snps k values from two to three hundred and thirtytwo were tested to determine the most statistically probable kvalue by average silhouette width s2 fig the largest average silhouette width was found to occur at k  eightyseven s2a fig individuals found within same cluster of eightyseven were then assigned to the same fold making it impossible for the most closely related individuals to be split across training and testing folds full clusters were assigned to one of five folds randomly controlling only for cluster size in order to produce three folds of sixtysix individuals and two folds of sixtyseven individuals a similar procedure was used by ly et al two thousand and thirteen 26
 
for each cross validation experiment one of the five folds served as the validation fold and the other four folds served as the training folds the process was repeated five times so that each fold served once as the validation fold resulting in predicted gebv values for all individuals accuracy was assessed as the mean pearson correlation of the predicted gebv and observed phenotype in the validation population
 
the cross validation experiments shown in table three were performed in order to test all logical combinations of years and seasons in the training and validation populations note that a years wet season was never used to predict the same years dry season because in southeast asia the dry season arrives first chronologically we did however predict the two thousand and twelve wet season both with and without the two thousand and twelve dry season present in the training population we tested scenarios in which both seasons per year were included in the training population as well as scenarios where only the data from the seasons matching the validation population were included in the training data eg using only the wet season data to predict the wet season we also sought to test scenarios using only more recent year data in the training population eg only 2011 or 20102011 and scenarios using more historical year data in the training population eg 20092011 table 3
 
as  all seasons ds  dry season only ws  wet season only
 
cross validation experiment one cv1 accuracies were calculated for all experiments with the validation yearseason included in the training population excluding individuals in the validation fold including the validation yearseason in the training population can bias accuracies upwards by confounding gxe and line effects however so in order to obtain an estimate of this bias we also performed cross validation experiments two and three cv2 cv3 for cv permutations 15 see above table for cv2 we excluded the validation yearseason from the training population these results are not directly comparable to those in which the training population contained the validation yearseason cv1 however because the training population for cv2 is smaller than was used for cv1 and training population size can have an important effect on prediction accuracy for this reason we performed cv3 in which we included the validation yearseason in the training population but removed the equivalent seasons from 2011 eg for the first crossvalidation permutation in the above table cv2 would not include the two thousand and twelve dry season in the training population and cv3 would include the two thousand and twelve dry season but would not include the two thousand and eleven dry season thus the estimate of bias can be calculated for a given cv permutation experiment as cv3 accuracy minus the cv2 accuracy 26 the bias was only estimated for the first five cv permutations because the bias estimates turned out to be small and similar to each other for all five cv permutations
 
for all three traits multiple years seasons and replicate yield entries existed along with the previously described covariates for all three hundred and thirtytwo individuals in order to build genomic selection models it was necessary to convert these raw yields into a single adjusted yield for each individual adjusted yields plant heights or days to flowering were calculated for each yearseason combination by fitting an initial linear model of the observations y by line id ghid x 1 and phenotype covariates described above eg lodging x 2n for the given year x season in jmp nonsignificant covariates as determined by an ftest    005 or covariates that resulted in singularities were removed and the model refit when all covariates included in the model were statistically significant the least squares mean yield for each line id was exported as the adjusted yield missing phenotype data were coded as null data for the above analysis or in other words no imputation or numeric filling of phenotypic values was performed
 
the least square means for each year and season were also used to calculate a correlation matrix for each trait s3 fig
 
for each experiment adjusted yields were calculated for each of the five training folds separately by fitting a linear model for each training fold as described above with the difference that data from all years and seasons for a particular cv experiment was including in the x matrices for all lines not in the validation fold year season and a year x season interaction were also included as covariates in the model and subject to the same significance requirements as the other model covariates
 
six statistical methods were used for each experiment including four genomic selection methods rrblup bayesian lasso bl reproducing kernel hilbert spaces rkhs and random forest rf and two nongenomic selection methods multiple linear regression mlr and pedigreeblup ped the four genomic selection methods were chosen based on their demonstrated success in accurately predicting gebv in variety of crops and because they represent the different types of statistical methodologies used to build gs models ie linear parametric methods rrblup bl nonlinear semiparametric methods rkhs nonlinear nonparametric methods rf as well as frequentist methods rrblup rkhs bayesian methods bl and machine learning methods rf 19234950656667 for an overview of the methods see lorenz et al 20118
 
multiple linear regression using a subset of markers derived from single marker regressions mlr another linear parametric statistical method was the fifth statistical method tested to predict breeding value and served as our used as a nongs markerbased prediction control for each fold single marker regression was run for all markers and pvalues determined for each marker by ftest note that this is the statistical equivalent of a crude gwas linear models were then tested using one through the first one hundred most significant markers and the model with the best fit was returned the returned model was then used to calculate the accuracy for the given fold for the marker subset experiments where the number of markers p was less than 100 models were tested using one through p markers mlr has been shown to be effective for agronomic traits with very simple genetic architectures but is otherwise not expected to perform well 51
 
prediction based on pedigree alone was the sixth statistical method and was performed in order to determine if a the fold design method properly controlled for family structure within the dataset and b if gs could outperform prediction based on pedigree alone 52
 
all statistical modeling was done in r for the pedigree models an amatrix was calculated using a threegeneration pedigree file for all individuals in the training and validation populations using a custom r function the models themselves were calculated using package rrblup function kinblup rrblup models were also calculated using package rrblup function kinshipblup rkhs models were calculated using kinshipblup kmethod  gauss modified so that parameter theta was always equal to 25 as per guidelines in the bglr package documentation 68 random forest was performed using package randomforest function randomforest bayesian lasso was performed using package blr function blr
 
narrow sense heritabilities were calculated for each trait on a per line basis using the rrblup package function mixedsolve with the least square means for the complete validation populations used as input the narrow sense heritabilities were calculated as the additive genetic variance divided by the total phenotypic variance the set of 73147 snps was used for all experiments with the exception of the marker subset experiments described below

we studied a total of fiftyseven individuals 18 pampas cat sixteen kodkod and twentythree geoffroys cat whose origin and phenotype are listed in table s1 in s1 data biological material was either blood collected from wildcaught individuals in the context of field ecology studies or tissue from roadkilled animals encountered during routine wildlife surveys in all cases sampling was performed following appropriate national regulations for handling animals and biological materials dna was prepared by extraction with phenolchloroform and assessed for concentration and quality by fluorometry and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively
 
when this work was initiated we made use of an annotated but incomplete 19x genome assembly of the domestic cat felcat3 39 during the course of the work two additional assemblies became available and all coordinates used in the manuscript now refer to felcat5feliscatus62 
 
after pcr amplification proteincoding exons of asip 8 and mc1r table s2 in s1 data were analyzed by automated capillary sequencing we first examined eight individuals of each species 4 of each phenotype then extended those results to all available samples supplemental tables s1 s4 s5 s6 sequencing electropherograms were verified and corrected with sequencher four point two genecodes corporation and every potential variant was carefully inspected for confirmation homologous nucleotide and amino acid sequences of each gene from additional mammalian species were obtained from genbank table s3 in s1 data and aligned using clustalw
 
dna libraries for illumina sequencing were generated using standard protocols briefly 700ng to 25ug of input dna depending on the level of dna degradation assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis before shearing was sheared to a size range of 100500 bp and custom inline barcodes were added during adapter ligation for pairedend sequencing
 
for target selection we utilized a set of fosmid libraries that had been previously endsequenced and mapped to a 3x draft assembly v17efelcat4 40 identity of all fosmids was verified by pcr of each end
 
a detailed protocol for probe preparation hybridization and capture is described elsewhere day et al manuscript submitted briefly fosmids were pooled according to their inferred individual mass a total of 15ug of input was sheared to 100500 bp and dna fragments were used to prepare biotinylated rna with a megascript t7 kit ambion after dnase treatment and removal of unincorporated nucleotides hybridizations were carried out in a volume of 26ul that contained three hundred ng of probe and 500ng of library dna 125ng each of four inline barcoded libraries selected dna was recovered with magnetic beads and amplified by pcr 20 cycles using standard illumina primers library 4plex pools were sequenced as 12plex library sets on a single illumina hiseq two thousand lane
 
we used asip and mc1r regions from chromosomes a3 and e2 respectively as reference sequences extracted from the feliscatus62 assembly the genomic reference was masked for transposable elements and low complexity regions with repeatmasker 41 to minimize genotyping errors related to interspecies differences in allele structure and distribution we first mapped all raw sequence reads against the domestic cat reference using the burrowswheeler aligner bwa with default parameters 42 then used samtools 43 to compute consensus sequences for these preliminary alignments and to de novo assemble targeted regions in each of the three species separately
 
sequence reads were then remapped to these de novo speciesspecific consensus sequences and subsequently used to for variant calling according to gatk best practices guidelines 44 briefly we started by applying alignment quality control procedures available in gatk to detect sequence intervals with low quality mappings ie possibly related to the presence of sequence variants such as small insertions or deletions in subsets of the analyzed samples in all such cases a thorough local realignment of the reads was performed to minimize the number of mismatching bases the gatk unified genotyper ug tool was applied on realigned reads to infer the genotype structure simultaneously across all samples for each species the raw genotype calls were subjected to a filtering procedure by imposing thresholds on a set of quality criteria including minor allele frequency maf10 phredscaled mapping quality mq40 ug quality by depth qd2 and ug haplotypescore13 the filtered calls were further restricted to a small subset of high quality calls to satisfy an average variant density threshold of 1 per 1kb of target sequence finally the beagle genetic analysis software package 45 was used to check genotype consistency across all samples of each species and infer the haplotype phase of selected variants
 
curated genotype and haplotype data was then used for downstream analyses including nucleotide diversity and polymorphism statistics with dnasp five point one zero 46 ehh 47 and generation of medianjoining haplotype networks network 4500  haplotype bifurcation plots in fig five were generated with sweep one point one  and rehh one point zero 48

the association of gene expression with bp was analyzed separately in each of the six studies equation 1 a linear mixed model was used in the fhs in order to account for family structure linear regression models were used in the other five studies in each study gene expression level denoted by geneexp was included as the dependent variable and explanatory variables included blood pressure phenotypes sbp dbp and htn and covariates included age sex body mass index bmi cell counts and technical covariates a separate regression model was fitted for each gene the general formula is shown below and the details of analyses for each study are provided in the s2 text and s6 table geneexpbpj1mcovariates
 
the overall analysis framework is provided in s1 fig we first identified differentially expressed genes associated with bp bp signature genes in the fhs samples set 1 and attempted replication in the metaanalysis results from the illumina cohorts set 2 see methods metaanalysis we next identified bp signature genes in the illumina cohorts set 2 and then attempted replication in the fhs samples set 1 the significance threshold for preselecting bp signature genes in discovery was at bonferroni corrected p  zero point zero five in fhs corrected for 17318 measured genes 17873 transcripts and in illumina cohorts corrected for 12010 measured genes 14222 transcripts that passed quality control replication was established at bonferroni corrected p  005 correcting for the number of preselected bp signatures genes in the discovery set we computed the pi1 value to estimate the enrichment of significant p values in the replication set the illumina cohorts for bp signatures identified in the discovery set the fhs by utilizing the r package qvalue 11 pi1 is defined as 1pi0 pi0 value provided by the qvalue package represents overall probability that the null hypothesis is true therefore pi1 value represents the proportion of significant results for genes passing bonferroni corrected p005 in the discovery set for sbp dbp and htn we calculated pi1 values for each gene set in the replication set
 
we performed metaanalysis of the five illumina cohorts for discovery and replication purposes and then performed metaanalysis of all six cohorts an inverse variance weighted metaanalysis was conducted using fixedeffects or randomeffects models by the metagen function in the r package meta  at first we tested heterogeneity for each gene using cochrans q statistic if the heterogeneity p value is significant p005 we will use a randomeffects model for the metaanalysis otherwise use a fixedeffects model the benjaminihochberg bh method 28 was used to calculate fdr for differentially expressed genes in relation to bp following the metaanalysis of all six cohorts we also used a more stringent threshold to define bp signature genes by utilizing p65e6 bonferroni correction for seven thousand seven hundred and seventeen unique genes 7810 transcript based on the overlap of fhs and illumina cohort interrogated gene sets
 
to estimate the proportion of variances in sbp or dbp explained by a group of differentially expressed bp signature genes gene 1 gene 2  gene n we used the following two models
 
full model bpi1ngeneij1mcovariates
 
null model bpj1mcovariates
 
the proportion of variance in bp attributable to the group of differentially expressed bp signature genes hbpsig2 was calculated as hbpsig2max0gnull2errnull2gfull2errfull2bp2 where bp2 is the total phenotypic variance of sbp or dbp gfull2 and errfull2 are the variance and error variance when modeling with the tested group of gene expression traits gene 1 gene 2  gene n and gnull2 and errnull2 are the variance and error variance when modeling without the tested group of gene expression traits
 
the proportion of the variance in bp phenotypes attributable to the fhs bp signature genes was estimated in the five illumina cohorts respectively and then the average proportion values were reported in turn the proportion of the variance in bp phenotypes attributable to the illumina bp signature genes was estimated in the fhs
 
snps associated with altered gene expression ie eqtls were identified using genomewide genotype and gene expression data in all available fhs samples n  5257 at fdr01 joehanes r submitted 2014 and a brief summary of methods and results are provided in the s2 text a ciseqtl was defined as an eqtl within one megabase mb flanking the gene other eqtls were defined as transeqtls we combined the eqtl list generated in the fhs with the eqtls generated by metaanalysis of seven other studies n  5300 that were also based on whole blood expression12
 
for every bp signature gene we estimated the proportion of variance in the transcript attributable to the corresponding cis or transeqtls heqtl2 using the formula heqtl2max0eqtlnull2errnull2eqtlfull2errfull2gene2 where gene2 was the total phenotypic variance of a gene expression trait eqtlfull2 and errfull2 were the variance and the residual error respectively when modeling with the tested eqtl eqtlnull2 and errnull2 were the variance and the residual error when modeling without the tested eqtl
 
in order to understand the biological themes within the global gene expression changes in relation to bp we performed gene set enrichment analysis29 to test for enrichment of any gene ontology go biology process30 or kegg pathways31 metric for ranking gene parameters were configured to the beta value of the metaanalysis in order to look at the top enriched functions for bp associated upregulated and downregulated gene expression changes respectively one thousand random permutations were conducted and the significance level was set at fdr zero point two five to allow for exploratory discovery 29

sequencing reads from three southeast asian cambodia n  253 thailand n  91 vietnam n  12 and two african populations gambia n  55 malawi n  60 of p falciparum clinical isolates 2 were aligned to the p falciparum 3d7 genome version 3 using smalt described in 2 for all samples the average coverage across the whole genome was at least 35fold variants were called using samtools 39 and vcftools 40 with default settings genotypes at snp positions were called using ratios of coverage with heterozygous calls converted to the majority genotype on a 7030 or greater coverage ratio 4 snps that reflected possible multiplicity of infection were removed as the imputation methods under evaluation cannot tolerate haploid and mixed genotypes simultaneously lowcoverage var and subtelomeric regions s9 table were discarded the 85967 biallelic and nonsingleton snps with less than 10 missing genotypes were retained which is approximately the inflection point beyond which snps experience a rapid increase in missingness s11 fig allowing more missing data by relaxing the threshold would lead to a decrease in imputation accuracy 17
 
performance of the imputation methods was evaluated with a leaveoneout crossvalidation approach using markers on chromosome 13 where two hundred and fifteen 2 snps were masked in each haplotype and imputed using the others as references this procedure produces an accuracy measure based on the squared pearson correlation allelic r 2 between the true and imputed allele probability for each marker 18 to prevent sampling bias from choosing only markers with completely known genotypes each population panel was split into several subpopulations of 2530 isolates each and independent rounds of crossvalidation were performed on a distinct set of markers in each subpopulation this procedure introduced representation of markers at varying levels of missingness and increased the total number of validated markers a concordance rate between true and bestguess genotypes on a calling threshold 09 was also calculated only the concordance of minor alleles is considered to mitigate the possibility of nearmonomorphic snps inflating overall concordance rates
 
imputation software established primarily for human genotype analysis were adapted to enable their application to parasite sequence data beagle v33 18 does not require recombination rates to inform its ld model and processes sporadically missing genotypes but only imputes diploid genotypes therefore we duplicated all positions to make sequences homozygous diploid before each imputation round then heterozygous imputed genotype probabilities were allocated equally between the two alternative alleles when computing allelic dosage for impute v20 controls allowing haploid imputation chrx useprephasedg knownhapsg were activated previously published recombination maps from two highquality genetic crosses between laboratory clones gb4x7g8 6213841 and hb3xdd2 6223841 were used to supply two sets of experimentally informed rates these two maps were considered separately and not combined an alternative set of population recombination rates 2n e r was inferred using the coalescentbased ldhat program interval 42 presupplied likelihood lookup files with a population mutation rate  value of zero point zero one were used the effective population size n e  30000 was derived by rescaling the compound map distance for gambian isolates inferred from interval to match the empirical map distance estimated from the gb4x7g8 cross the scaling factor was treated as a pseudon e used to adjust compound rates uniformly on the other populations to test the robustness of assuming the above parameter values for  and n e we computed accuracy using different values for one african gambia and one southeast asian thailand population s2 table
 
multiple haplotype sets were sampled from the marginal posterior genotype distribution under the bestperforming imputation designs this procedure allowed the computation of population genetics metrics under a multiple imputationlike schema accounting for uncertainty in the true identity of genotypes ten snp datasets were completed for each imputation strategy through sampling from posterior genotype probabilities and relevant population genetics metrics at each snp or gene were computed and averaged across the sets two metrics were used to infer recent positive selection the integrated haplotype score ihs and rsb ihs is the standardized log ratio of the integrated extendedhaplotype homozygosity ehh between the ancestral and derived allele at a core snp 43 capturing evidence of unusually long haplotypes surrounding a particular allele within the population the ancestral and derived alleles were defined to be the major and minor allele at malawian snps as this population is ancestrally ancient 616 and the rapid ld decay made it a natural reference point for detecting extended haplotype homozygosity in other populations absolute values of ihs were used to capture long haplotypes centred around either type of allele using a minimum maf filter of 5 rsb is the standardized log ratio of the integrated sitespecific ehh between populations at a core snp where sitespecific ehh refers to the weighted average of ehh surrounding a core snp according to squaredallele frequencies 26 because sitespecific ehh does not require markers to be polymorphic within the population it can detect selective sweeps for alleles that have risen to fixation both ihs and rsb were calculated using the scanhh program in the r package rehh 44 which excludes markers with any missing data the allele frequencybased tajimas d approach 11 was used to detect balancing selection at each gene with greater evidence from increasing values from zero whilst different populations have different demographic histories it is difficult to account for this and establish multiple thresholds for the different null distributions of tajimas d to negate any confounding effects of population expansion and difficulties in establishing significance levels we report genes with tajimas d values in excess of one 6 the function neutralitystats from the r package popgenome was used 45 parasite population structure was analysed using principal components analysis implemented via the classical multidimensional scaling method using the function cmdscale in r in addition pairwise population fst with 95 bootstrap confidence intervals was computed using the function stamppfst in the r package stampp 46

rna was purified using a ribopure yeast kit life technologies ambion cat number am1926 to prepare the libraries for rna sequencing we used the scriptseq complete gold kit yeast epicentre cat number bgy1306 this kit allows for effective depletion of all yeast rrna species and also preserves information about rna strand size distribution of the resulting libraries was estimated by both agarose gel electrophoresis followed by sybr gold or sybr green both from life technologies staining and visualization on typhoon scanner and bioanalyzer agilent technologies we have used two rna samples from the lan210 strain expressing pmcda1 and one rna sample from the lan210 sub1 strain expressing pmcda1 rna was purified from the same cultures used to measure mutation frequencies the libraries were pooled together and sequenced on a hiseq2500 instrument using one hundred bp pairedend reads
 
all dna illumina reads were filtered by base quality threshold phred score 20 5 trimmed see s1 protocol for details adapters were filtered from the 3 end of reads s1 protocol minimum read length after filtering was set to twenty point the filtering steps were performed using trim galore  next filtered reads were corrected by bayeshammer module of spades assembler 78
 
roche reads were cut to a length of four hundred and seventynine and then eleven bp from the 5 end of reads were trimmed after this reads were filtered by base quality using fastqqualityfilter parametersq 20p 80 from fastx package 
 
we have improved the genome of our reference strain lan210 28 by taking advantage of longer reads obtained from roche sequencing run assembling and correction of assembling errors were performed in several steps see diagram in s7 fig
 
in the first step n008lan210wtnanarun2 and roche reads were assembled de novo to contigs using mira assembler v four point zero  contigs with a length of five hundred bp and more were aligned to standard yeast reference genome s288cr64 using bwa mem algorithm 075a  then the consensus sequence designated as raw reference was extracted from alignment using samtools v0119 79 
 
in the second step filtered and corrected sequencing reads from the wildtype lan210 strain n008lan210wtnanarun2 were aligned to the raw reference and variants were extracted from alignment as described in the section detection of variants then homozygous variants were used to correct the raw reference to the intermediate reference using gatk 
 
in the last step common homozygous variants from alignments of corrected and filtered reads from sequencing lan200 and lan201 strains clones n001lan200wtnanarun1 and n002lan201wtnanarun1 were used in the same way as described previously to get the final reference genome s2 datasetlan210v010m genome in fasta format
 
the saccharomyces genome database sgd wwwyeastgenomeorg lacks utr annotations we have combined the published utr annotations 34 with sgd annotations of standard yeast reference s288c s288cr64 these merged annotations were transferred to the lan210v010m genome sequence using a custom script based on blast the annotations in the gff format can be found in s3 dataset
 
repeats in lan210v010m were masked using four sources see s1 protocol and s7 fig first interspersed repeats were discovered de novo using repeat modeler  then they were combined with known fungal repeats from repbase  and both were masked using repeat masker  second tandem repeats were raw masked using trf 80  then raw masked tandem repeats were checked for over masking known problem of trf using lan210v010m annotations entries in genes were removed third all trna features were masked fourth manual masking based on bwa alignment of contigs see assembly of lan210 reference genomesection to lan210v010m was performed resulting in regions with conflicting contigs being masked
 
for each clonesample see table 1 corrected and filtered reads as described previously were aligned to the lan210v010m genome using bowtie2 v210 81  in verysensitive mode then the variant call was performed using unified genotyper with optionsstandcallconf 100standemitconf 40 from gatk for both indels and snps after that snps and indels were split and independently filtered according to the gatks best practices  finally filtered indels and snvs from lan200 lan201 and lan210 n008lan210wtnanarun2 n001lan200wtnanarun1 and n002lan201wtnanarun1 were combined only snvs were further considered for all other samples for snvs in deaminaseinduced mutants the last filtration step was associated with clustering described below
 
genomes of diploid yeast mutants induced by deaminases possess hundreds to thousands of mutations 28 and table 1 making these data a good material to detect the hypermutable genomic regions to increase the sensitivity of detection even further we pooled the mutations from the clones induced by the same deaminase together the resulting datasets are characterized by very high mutation densities over the relatively small yeast genome because of that we developed a sophisticated clustering procedure that was applied for combined snv sample sets and consisted of several stages see scheme in s8 fig
 
in the first step hierarchical clustering was performed using the scipy library  in hierarchical clustering objects are grouped together based on distances between them in nested clusters until a single cluster harboring all objects is formed the structure of derived clustering can be easily represented as a tree at this time the choice of a method to calculate the distances between objects and clusters is highly important however there is still no general approach to make such choice so one has to choose an appropriate method based on the features of the data he is studying we choose an average distance upgma method to calculate the distances between clusters the reasons are described below in this case a distance du v between two clusters of objects u and v is calculated as follows duv  ijdui vjuv where dui vj is the distance between the ith object from cluster u and the jth object from cluster v and u and v are numbers of objects in clusters u and v respectively the average distance used to perform hierarchical clustering and the distance criterion used to extract clusters do not set strict limitations for cluster length importantly one kb is not the maximum length of a cluster as some clusters are longer the threshold is based on cophenetic distance see below also the upgma method takes into account distances between all mutations in the cluster in comparison to npa nearest point algorithm or fpa farthest point algorithm
 
if there is no interest in hierarchical clustering process as it but instead one would like to obtain a set of clusters a method and threshold to extract them from the clustering tree have to be chosen we choose a distance criterion as the most appropriate method this means that all snvs in each extracted cluster should have no greater than a cophenetic distance than the threshold the cophenetic distance between two objects is the distance between the largest two clusters containing these objects individually when they are merged into a single cluster that contains both in other words it is the height of the tree where the two branches including the two objects merge together for our purposes clusters are defined as clusters extracted from hierarchical clustering it is important to distinguish them from nested clusters of hierarchical clustering
 
to set a threshold for extraction of clusters we performed an extraction with different values of threshold in a range from fifty bp to five thousand bp with a fifty bp step the number of clusters with three or more mutations reaches or nearly reaches a plateau when the threshold was set to a value in the range of one thousand to two thousand bp s2 fig considering the high density of mutations in our dataset and a priori knowledge of approximate cluster size rainfall plot we have set the cutoff for extraction to one thousand bp
 
the distance criterion was used for extraction because except for clustered mutations there was a noise consisting of random mutations it was impossible to predict the number of clusters or to directly use more natural methods such as an inconsistency coefficient which was used to adjust clusters in the next step
 
in the second step hierarchical clustering was performed independently for the snvs in each cluster and subclusters were extracted using inconsistency coefficient with the threshold set to zero point eight and depth set to two to adjust the borders of clusters the inconsistency coefficient characterizes each link in a cluster tree by comparing its height with the average height of adjacent links that are less than the depth value below it in the cluster hierarchy the higher value of this coefficient indicates the lower similarity of the objects connected by the link
 
in the third step a filtering of clusters was performed all clusters with one or more snv in the masked see repeat maskingabove regions were removed also for deaminase sample sets clusters with more than one nondeaminaselike snv non ct or ga were considered as errors of sequencing or snv call and removed from analysis in other words filtering of snvs for deaminase sample sets is merged with clustering filtration clusters with one nondeaminaselike snv present in only one sample in a set were marked and corresponding snvs were removed at this step snvs for each sample were independently restored from clustering results the final snv datasets can be found in s1 dataset
 
finally clusters were filtered based on their size only clusters with five and more snvs were retained and power calculated as the size of a cluster divided by the median distance between snvs in the cluster the minimum power threshold was set to zero point zero five to remove the clusters with a low density of snv that may be due to highlevel noise because of high mutation densities
 
we have used top hat followed by cufflinks 82 in annotationguided modes to obtain fpkm values for the genes annotated in our reference genome fpkm stands for fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads and represents relative expression values for the genes andor transcripts
 
analysis of mutation densities around cds startutrtss was performed using custom scripts s2 protocol sequence logos fig 1 were created from pooled snv data in weblogo three point zero  using s cerevisiae gc content 38 for values normalization sequences were reversecomplemented where applicable using fastxtoolkit  due to the relatively low number of mutations in the genomes of apobec3ginduced mutants and the resulting increased ratio of false positive snvs to the real mutations the results of the automatic snv call were manually checked in the genome browser the manually filtered snvs dataset was used for logo creation
 
most of the statistical tests have been computed in r

this eqtl metaanalysis is based on gene expression intensities measured in whole blood samples rna was isolated with either paxgene tubes becton dickinson and co franklin lakes nj usa or tempus tubes life technologies to measure gene expression levels illumina wholegenome expression beadchips were used ht12v3 and ht12v4 arrays illumina inc san diego usa although different identifiers are used across these different platforms many probe sequences are identical metaanalysis could thus be performed if probesequences were equal across platforms integration of these probe sequences was performed as described before 22 genotypes were harmonized using hapmap2based imputation using the central european population 32 in total the eqtl genotype x environment interaction metaanalysis was performed on seven independent cohorts comprising a total of 5863 unrelated individuals full descriptions of these cohorts can be found in the supplementary note mixups between gene expression samples and genotype samples were corrected using mixupmapper 33
 
each cohort performed gene expression normalization individually gene expression data was quantile normalized to the median distribution then log2 transformed the probe and sample means were centered to zero gene expression data was then corrected for possible population structure by removing four multidimensional scaling components mds components obtained from the genotype data using plink using linear regression additionally we corrected for possible confounding factors due to arrays of poor rna quality we reasoned that arrays of poor rna quality generally show expression for genes that are normally lowly expressed within the tissue eg expression for brain genes in whole blood data as such the expression profiles for such arrays will deviate overall from arrays with proper rna quality to capture such variable arrays we calculated the first pc from the sample correlation matrix and correlated the first pc with the sample gene expression measurements samples with a correlation  zero point nine were removed from further analysis s9 fig
 
in order to improve statistical power to detect celltype mediated eqtls we corrected the gene expression for technical and batch effects here we applied principal component analysis and removed per cohort the forty strongest principal components that affect gene expression such procedures are commonly used when conducting ciseqtl mapping 2522303134 to minimize the amount of genetic variation removed by this procedure we performed qtl mapping for each principal component to ascertain whether genetic variants could be detected that affected the pc if such an effect was detected we did not correct the gene expression data for that particular pc 22 as a result this procedure also removed the majority of the variation that explained the correlation between neutrophil percentage and gene expression s10 fig minimizing issues with possible collinearity when testing the interaction effects we chose to remove forty pcs based on our previous study results which suggested that this was the optimum for detecting eqtls 22 we would like to stress that while pccorrected gene expression data was then used as the outcome variable in our gene x environment interaction model we used gene expression data that was not corrected for pcs to initially create the neutrophil cell percentage proxy
 
to be able to determine whether a ciseqtl is mediated by neutrophils we reasoned that such a ciseqtl would show a larger effect size in individuals with a higher percentage of neutrophils than in individuals with a lower percentage however this required the percentage of neutrophils in whole blood to be known and celltype percentage measurements were not available for all of the cohorts we therefore created a proxy phenotype that reflected the actual neutrophil percentage that would also be applicable to datasets without neutrophil percentage measurements in the egcut dataset we first quantile normalized and log2 transformed the raw expression data we then correlated the gene expression levels of individual probes with the neutrophil percentage and selected fiftyeight gene expression probes showing a high positive correlation spearman r  057 here we chose to use the quantile normalized log2 transformed gene expression data that was not corrected for principal components since correction for principal components would remove the correlation structure between gene expression and neutrophil percentage s10 fig
 
in each independent cohort we corrected for possible confounding factors due to arrays with poor rna quality by correlating the quantile normalized and log2 transformed gene expression measurements against the first pc determined from the sample correlation matrix only samples with a high correlation r  09 were included in further analyses then for each cohort we calculated a correlation matrix for the neutrophil proxy probes the probes selected from the egcut cohort the gene expression data used was quantile normalized log2 transformed and corrected for mds components applying pca to the correlation matrix we then obtained pcs that described the variation among the probes selected from the egcut cohort as the first pc pc1 contributes the largest amount of variation we considered pc1 as a proxyphenotype for the cell type percentages
 
considering the overlap between the cohorts in this study and our previous study we limited our analysis to the 13124 ciseqtls having a significant effect false discovery rate fdr  005 in our previous study 22 this included 8228 unique illumina ht12v3 probes and 10260 unique snps 7674 snps that showed the strongest effect per probe and 2586 snps previously associated with complex traits and diseases as reported in the catalog of published genomewide association studies 1 on 23rd september 2013
 
we defined the model for single marker ciseqtl mapping as follows yi1ge where y is the gene expression of the gene  one is the slope of the linear model g is the genotype i is the intercept with the yaxis and e is the general error term for any residual variation not explained by the rest of the model
 
we then extended the typical linear model for single marker ciseqtl mapping to include a covariate as an independent variable and captured the interaction between the genotype and the covariate using an interaction term yi1g2p3pge where p celltype proxy is the covariate and pg is the interaction term between the covariate and the genotype we used gene expression data corrected for forty pcs as the predicted variable y the interaction terms were then metaanalyzed over all cohorts using a zscore method weighted for the sample size 35
 
since the geneexpression data has a correlated structure ie coexpressed genes and the genotype data also has a correlated structure ie linkage disequilibrium between snps a bonferroni correction would be overly stringent we therefore first estimated the effective number of uncorrelated tests by using permuted eqtl results from our previous ciseqtl metaanalysis 22 the most significant pvalue in these permutations was eight point one five x 105 when averaged over all permutations as such the number of effective tests  zero point five  eight point one five x 105  6134 which is approximately half the number of correlated ciseqtl tests that we conducted  13124 next we controlled the fdr at zero point zero five for the interaction analysis for a given pvalue threshold in our interaction analysis we calculated the number of expected results given the number of effective tests and a uniform distribution and determined the observed number of eqtls that were below the given pvalue threshold fdr  number of expected pvalues below threshold  number of observed pvalues below threshold at an fdr of 005 our nominal pvalue threshold was zero point zero zero nine corresponding to an absolute interaction effect zscore of 261
 
for each trait in the gwas catalog we pruned all snps with a gwas association pvalue below five x 108 using an r2 threshold of 02 we only considered traits that had more than twenty significant eqtl snps after pruning irrespective of celltype mediation then we determined the proportion of pruned neutrophilmediated ciseqtls for the trait relative to all the neutrophilmediated ciseqtls the difference between both proportions was then tested using a binomial test

aris37secreted ccgfp i cup5ar465 iii sma9cc604 x animals lacking mderived coelomocytes having a total of four ccs were treated with fifty mm ethyl methanesulfonate ems individual f1 animals were picked to 3f1s per plate and their combined f2 progeny were screened for the restoration of m lineagederived coelomocytes having a total of 56 ccs by direct visual examination using a fluorescence stereomicroscope plates that segregated 525 of animals with six ccs were kept for further analysis including determining whether the mutations bred true the degree of suppression for each suppressor mutation when homozygous and whether the mutations are dominant or recessive
 
by screening through 5300 haploid genomes using the above method we isolated thirtyseven truebreeding sma9 suppressors named susm suppressor of sm a9 mutations jj49jj85 table 2 four of these jj68 jj80 jj81 and jj84 showed a relatively low degree of suppression near 30 table 2 and were not further characterized in this work jj58 might be a dominant mutation and was not further analyzed all of the remaining susm alleles appear to be recessive single locus mutations although some suppressors exhibited partial dominance in their susm phenotype tables one and 2 the suppressor mutations were then mapped to chromosome x or chromosome iii based on their linkage to sma9cc604 x or to cup5ar465 iii further complementation tests were carried out between each suppressor mutation and mutations in each known members of the smamab pathway and between different suppressor mutations that did not affect known genes in the smamab pathway
 
lw0214 which has aris37secreted ccgfp i and sma9cc604 x introgressed into the cb4856 hawaiian strain by 6x backcrossing was used for mapping the sma9 suppressors via snipsnp mapping 83 and whole genome sequencing wgs 84 lw0214 was tested using a panel of snp markers and subsequently by wgs and found to contain cb4856 snps for all six chromosomes except for the following regions that still contain n2 snp markers chromosome ifrom the left end to 12 and from 24 to the right end chromosome iifrom the left end to 18 and chromosome xbetween 173 and 11 snipsnp markers used were described in wicks et al 83 and davis et al 85
 
for the sma9 suppressor mutations that appeared to affect known genes in the smamab pathway either by complementation tests or by whole genome sequencing wgs see below their molecular lesions were identified by sequencing pcr products spanning the entire genomic regions of the corresponding genes which include dbl1 daf4 sma6 sma2 sma3 sma4 lon1 sma10 and unc40 for jj69 that contains a single base pair change in the upstream regulatory region of sma6 a plasmid pjkl1060 which contains 3kb of upstream sequences the genomic coding region and 2kb of downstream sequences of sma6 was used to rescue the susm phenotype of jj69
 
direct wgs of the homozygous suppressor mutant dna was performed for some sma9 suppressors for others the suppressors were simultaneously mapped and identified using the snpwgs method of doitsidou et al 84 for the snpwgs method each sma9 suppressor mutant was crossed with lw0214 which has sma9 introgressed into the polymorphic hawaiian strain cb4856 described above between thirtysix and fiftynine f2 progeny that were homozygous for both sma9 and the suppressor mutation were collected f3 generation worms from these f2 progeny were pooled for dna extraction and library construction worm genomic dna was prepared using the qiagen gentra puregene kit 5g of genomic dna was used to prepare the sequencing library using the nebnext dna sample prep master mix set one point singleend 50bp shortread 51 cycle sequencing was performed on the hiseq two thousand instrument illumina yielding thirtyeight  seventyeight million reads 20  fortyone fold coverage per sample
 
for direct wgs jj58 jj60 jj61 jj71 jj77 data analysis was done using the maqgene platform 86 87 with the default setting snp variants on the x chromosome compared to the reference c elegans genome ce6 w221 were analyzed genes with missense snp variants in jj60 and jj77 but not in jj58 and jj71 were among the candidate genes that were targeted by rnai for their ability to suppress the sma9cc604 m lineage defects by injection these included c41a31 k09c48 and c17g18 further pcr and sequencing confirmed the jj60 and jj77 mutations in c17g18 tsp21
 
for mapping additional suppressors using either direct wgs for jj2 jj5 jj7 jj50 jj52 and jj70 or snpwgs for jj49 jj57 jj62 jj69 jj71 jj73 jj78 and jj83 sequence data were aligned to c elegans reference genome version ws220 using bfast 88 with default parameters snp calling was performed by samtools 89 a valid snp call required a minimum read depth of three annovar 90 was used for annotation of snp coding potential for snpwgs hawaiian snps were annotated with a custom perl script scatter plots of heterozygous 0207 fraction of total reads hawaiian snps were generated as chromosome position vs fractional total graphs mapping intervals were defined by visual inspection for gaps ie hawaiian snp fraction 02 candidate suppressor genes were identified as homozygous fraction 08 nonhawaiian nonsynonymous snps in the mapped interval the snps in the identified suppressor genes were verified by pcr and sequencing
 
jj61 was mapped via snpwgs to the region on the x chromosome where lon2 is located direct inspection of the sequence reads around the lon2 region showed that jj61 contains a large deletion 118kb spanning the lon2 region which was subsequently verified by pcr and sequencing

we identified tetraspanin homologs by running hmmsearch from hmmer 31b1 94 with the hidden markov model hmm profile for tetraspanins pf0033515 from pfam twentyseven point zero 95 against the reference proteome set of the quest for orthologs consortium 96 source url ftpftpebiacukpubdatabasesreferenceproteomesqfoqforelease201404targz hmmsearch was run with the arguments e 1e06dome 1e06ince 1e06incdome 1e06a alignment which generated aligned regions of similarity to these core domains since the regions of homology were extracted from fulllength proteins with an hmm the specific residues extracted were generally a subset of the full protein moreover it was possible for two or more such regions to be independently extracted from a single protein chain although this proved rare for tetraspanins
 
these regions were then realigned with mafft v7158b 97 in linsi its slowest and most reliable mode using the arguments localpairmaxiterate 1000 the resulting alignments were purged of poorly aligned members by first running trimal v14rev15 98 using the argument gt 05 and then running bmge one point one 99 using the arguments t aah 1g 051 this purged the alignments of any columns in which over 50 of the columns positions consisted of gaps rather than amino acid residues and then any sequences in which over 50 of the residues were gapped yielding global alignments that lacked excessive loops and gaps from the filtered alignments we computed protein maximumlikelihood phylogenies with a wag model of amino acid evolution 100 and with pseudocounts for gaps via fasttree 217 101 using the arguments pseudowag confidence values for the branches of trees ranging from zero point zero zero to 100 were automatically computed by fasttree with 1000 internal replicates we visualized the resulting trees with figtree 142  branch lengths were measured in average substitutions when comparing full sequences or their profiles among nongap positions in the aligned sequences with distances derived from the blosum45 matrix a correction for multiple substitutions and an allowed maximum of three point zero substitutions per individual site 102

recent analyses of mtdna variants1112 have taken an approach that determines homoplasmic and heteroplasmic sites directly based on allele counts of sequence reads this approach does not account for error rates in sequence reads and hence potentially results in both false positive and false negative variant calls we propose a likelihoodbased model that takes into account the sequencing error rate at each base in each sequence read the algorithm builds on the conventional autosomal dna variant callers67 but is modified to allow for allele fractions ie heteroplasmic levels at a variant site to vary across individuals
 
we aim to predict the genotype at each mtdna position one individual at a time therefore the subscripts indicating mtdna position and individual are suppressed for simplicity at each mtdna base position we use g to denote one individuals genotype in theory g can take fifteen possible values a c g t ac ag at cg ct gt acg act agt cgt acgt if g takes one of the first four possible genotypes with a single allele it is by definition called a homoplasmy however by convention if the genotype is the same as the standard reference allele it is not counted as a homoplasmy the remaining eleven possible genotypes are called heteroplasmies we estimate the posterior probability of having a certain genotype g given all the observed sequence reads pgreadspreadsgpg1 where pgreads is the posterior probability preadsg is called genotype likelihood and pg is the prior probability of genotype g which can be assigned by researchers we can then assign the genotype with highest posterior probability to the site for the individual so the key is to estimate fifteen genotype likelihoods preadsg
 
assuming the mtdna site of interest is covered by n sequence reads we use ri to denote the called base from read i i  1 2  n and ei to denote the corresponding sequencing error rate of that base for read i which can be estimated from the corresponding phredlike base quality score qi ei10qi10
 
we assume that each sequence read represents an independent random sampling from the multiple copies of mtdna in a cell and therefore a genotype likelihood can be estimated by preadsgi1nprig2 when g has only one allele ie g  a c g t pr ig can be directly estimated while considering the base error rate prig1eiifrigei3ifrig
 
because a cell has multiple copies of mtdna and each individual can have different fractions for the alleles when g has more than one allele ie g  ac ag at cg ct gt acg act agt cgt acgt we need to introduce allele fractions as unknown parameters of interest to be estimated by maximum likelihood for example when g has two alleles g one and g 2 g 1 g two  a c g t we denote by f one and f two the allele fractions of g one and g two for the individual respectively then prig1eif1ei3f2ifrig11eif2ei3f1ifrig2ei3ifrig1rig2
 
because f 1f two  1 we effectively have a single unknown parameter in the above equation similarly we can derive the corresponding formulas when g has three or four alleles with more allele fractions as unknown parameters see s1 text
 
we next consider all the reads covering the mtdna site of interest and update the genotype likelihoods as a function of allele fractions using eq two point when g has more than one allele we maximize the genotype likelihood functions using allele fractions as parameters the simplex method for maximization is implemented in our variant calling algorithm we then use maximized genotype likelihood to estimate posterior probabilities in eq one point
 
we note that a similar idea was recently proposed by ye et al13 to identify mtdna heteroplasmies in sequences from one thousand genomes project participants our publicly available software package was developed independently and further accounts for the circularity of the mtdna genome see below and identifies both homoplasmies and heteroplasmies
 
even though mtdna has a circular genome current studies investigating the mtdna variation from sequencing data employ a linear genome as reference to align sequence reads typically researchers use the revised cambridge reference sequence rcrs gene bank number nc012920 as the mtdna reference with a breakpoint introduced in the replication control region to start at position one and end at position 16569 as a result sequence reads that link the two ends ie those that cover the artificial breakpoint in the circular genome are not aligned and are discarded consequently the variant caller uses an incomplete set of reads to identify variants we propose a double alignment strategy using two linear reference genomes in sequence read alignment s1 fig the conventional rcrs is the reference for the first sequence alignment and variants are then identified only in the internal region of the genome eg from position 4000 to position 12000 skipping the two artificial ends of the rcrs a shifted rcrs reference is then created by making a breakpoint in the middle of the circular sequence position 8000 the shifted rcrs thus starts at the original position 8000 and ends at the original position 7999 s1 fig the sequence alignment is then repeated using the shifted rcrs as reference intuitively one could simply align the wholegenome sequence reads to the human nuclear genome plus the shifted rcrs reference but we propose a more efficient approach that combines the unmapped reads and reads mapped to rcrs reference from the first alignment and then uses them as the input reads for the second alignment this approach guarantees that all the reads covering the original break point are included in the analysis we then use the variant caller to call variants between original positions one to 4000 and between 12000 to 16569 variant calling in these two regions is not affected by the breakpoint at position 8000 finally we combine the two sets of called variants from the two alignments to obtain a complete set of variants for the whole mtdna genome the pipeline for the double alignment procedure is outlined in fig one point when the double alignment strategy was applied in our sardinia data set the most significant read depth increase was observed in the one hundred bp region on each side of the breakpoint with a 21fold increase or raw coverage increase of 114x in average depth see s1 text for more discussion on the coverage
 
the mtdna variant caller was applied to wholegenome sequence data of 2077 individuals selected among 6921 participants in the sardinia study of the genetics of quantitative traits in the sardinian founder population 8 the details on the selection of individuals to be sequenced are in s1 text
 
sequence data were generated at the university of michigan medical school core sequencing lab dna was extracted by a standard saltingout method from whole blood samples after a red blood cell lysing step libraries were generated from 35 g of genomic dna using sample preparation kits from illumina and new england biolabs pairedend sequence reads typically one hundred to one hundred and twenty bp in length were generated with illumina genome analyzer iix and illumina hiseq two thousand instruments samples were sequenced to an average depth of 42x
 
reads were aligned to the human reference genome grch37 assembly with decoy sequences as available in the one thousand genomes project ftp site ftpftp1000genomesebiacuk using bwa version 059 allowing at most five differences mismatches or gaps and trimming read tails with average base quality 15 after alignment base qualities were recalibrated and duplicate reads were flagged and excluded from analysis we reviewed summary metrics generated using qplot and verifybamid for each aligned sample to remove samples with low sequencing depth poor coverage of regions with high or low gc content or evidence for sample contamination
 
we then extracted from all sequence reads those that were uniquely mapped to the mtdna reference genome by bwa with a mapping quality score 20 ie the theoretical probability of wrong alignment 1 the mtdna variant caller was applied only to these mtdna reads fig one outlines the pipeline for aligning sequence reads to the whole genome reference extracting mtdna reads and applying the mtdna variant caller taking into account the circularity of the mtdna genome
 
in implementing the likelihoodbased model to identify mtdna variants we also applied quality control filters to help avoid the inclusion of false variants because of sequencing errors at a position of interest in mtdna we considered only reads with base sequencing error rate 1 ie recalibrated base quality score 20 we also applied sequencing depth filters we required an overall mtdna median depth  one hundred for an individual to be included in the analysis and at each base of interest for variant calling we required a raw depth 40 and a depth 10 after base quality score filtering at twenty point to call a heteroplasmy we further required that 1 all alleles of the called genotype are observed at least once in both forward and reverse strand sequence reads and 2 the minor allele fraction maf for an individual is  4 the maf threshold was chosen based on simulations in which we mimicked the sardinia sequencing experiments and simulated similar coverage data with reads of comparable quality scores see s1 text for details an maf threshold of 4 corresponded to an empirical false discovery rate ie the proportion of false heteroplasmies among all identified heteroplasmies of 2 we also used data from a deeply sequenced parentchild trio 80fold average coverage for nuclear dna and 6000fold average coverage for mtdna to evaluate the accuracy of variant calling for the same three individuals from the lowpass sequencing data using the results from deepsequencing data as gold standards we confirmed all the heteroplasmies identified in the three individuals by our variant caller with the 4 maf cutoff we found no false negatives in the child or the mother of the trio but did see one false negative in the father by contrast if we lowered the maf cutoff to a less stringent threshold of 16 we observed an average false discovery rate of 30 looking at deep sequencing data from a few individuals could not provide a definite guideline about the maf cutoff but supports well the choice of a 4 maf cutoff for this dataset
 
we have also considered the possibility that nuclear copies of parts of mtdna sequence ie nuclear mitochondrial dna or numts might be the source of false positives for heteroplasmies in our analysis as mentioned above we included only reads that were uniquely mapped to mtdna with further analyses on sampled individual cases we found that any representation of numts is minimal and should therefore not restrict the utility of the method see s1 text for a detailed discussion
 
we used publicly available online software haplogrep  to classify sardinia individuals into different haplogroups based on mtdna and annovar14 to annotate the called variants on mtdna and assess whether homoplasmies and heteroplasmies show different distributions in functional categories
 
assuming autosomal and mtdna are handled and sequenced with no significant differences average sequencing coverage should be proportional to dna copy number for autosomal and mtdna mtdnaaveragecoveragemtdnacopynumberpercellautosomaldnaaveragecoverageautosomaldnacopynumberpercell
 
as a proof of principle we looked at the average depth of coverage across the twentytwo autosomal chromosomes for one hundred randomly selected individuals and observed that as expected sequencing depth was largely flat across twentytwo chromosomes for each individual s2 fig
 
because there are two copies of autosomal dna in a cell we could infer the mtdna copy number by mtdnacopynumberpercellmtdnaaveragecoverageautosomaldnaaveragecoverage23
 
we used samtools  to obtain the coverage of each base in the genome from the aligned bam15 files the average coverages for autosomal dna and mtdna were then calculated accordingly
 
we applied our computational method to the same wholegenome sequencing data from 2077 sardinians and estimated mtdna copy number for each sample we also used a novaquant human mitochondrial to nuclear dna ratio kit emd chemicals inc to validate a random group of eighteen samples experimentally by qpcr see s1 text for more details we tested for age and gender effects on the mtdna copy number and also assessed any association of mtdna copy number with eleven quantitative traits collected for the cohort that include five anthropometric traits height weight bmi waist circumference and waisthip ratio two frailty traits walking speed and grip strength and four lipid traits hdlcholesterol ldlcholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides in addition poly software  was used to estimate the heritability of mtdna copy number based on the known family structure in the sardinia cohort
 
we note that a similar framework has been suggested by chu and colleagues16 to estimate copy number however their method identified only reads mapped to mtdna and counted all the remaining reads as mapped to nuclear dna as a result it would include unmappable reads in calculations and would thus overestimate the nuclear dna sequence coverage furthermore in calculating the effective length of human genome their method did not exclude the regions in the nuclear dna that could not be covered by sequencing our computational method avoids those pitfalls and hence should provide more accurate copy number estimates here we also validate the method with qpcr and implement it to estimate mtdna copy number in a largescale population study

motor testing encompassed both rotarod and grip test as described trushina et al 2014 xun et al 2012 weight and littersize were also quantified animals in each group were evaluated for rotarod performance and grip strength at the indicated ages mice were lowered onto the already spinning rotarod ugo basile at the required speed 10 and twenty rpm were used in this study the amount of time the animals stayed on the rotarod was determined by a builtin magnetic tripswitch which was stopped when the animal fell off mice were timed on the rotarod for a maximum of 120s with three attempts given for each mouse to attain 120s animals were tested for one session each day at each speed for five consecutive days and the best times for each trial were averaged for each animal for grip strength test mice were lowered onto a parallel rod d  zero point two five cm placed fifty cm above a padded surface the mice were allowed to grab the rod with their forelimbs after which they were released and scored for their success in holding onto the bar for thirty s mice were allowed three attempts to pass the bar test each day of testing and were tested for five consecutive days any one successful attempt to hold onto the bar was scored as a pass the percentage of animals that fell and failed the test was measured and recorded as a percentage of the total number of animals tested per genotype and age group mice were immediately sacrificed at the end of the 5day testing period average number of mice tested per genotype and age group was greater than 12 with an approximately equal malefemale ratio 407 males351 females in the six genotypes that were focused on for analysis

there are three groups the initial allele distribution of the inherited repeat is subtracted from the somatic repeats at the age of interest to normalize changes r uses an iterative curve fitting routine to a gaussian simple peak shape model the heterozygous hdhq150wt animals have only one peak to fit for homozygous animals hdhq150q150 if the two peak distributions are coincident or are very far apart the initial allele distribution of the inherited repeat is the same as for heterozygous animals if the peaks are partially overlapping we use iterative fitting routines of r the statistical program to resolve them mathematical resolution of the two peaks occurs only once ie we do not follow the same animals with time and compound errors by refitting the results from the same animals at multiple ages in our case we fit to a gaussian function using two nonlinear parameters peak position and peak width the peak height is a linear parameter and is determined by regression in r peak resolution is not performed by linear leastsquares methods because such signals cannot be modeled as polynomials with linear coefficients the positions and widths of the peaks are not linear functions compared to the simpler polynomial leastsquares methods for measuring peaks the iterative method has the advantage of using all the data points across the entire peak including zero and negative points this method can be applied to resolve multiple overlapping peaks to a high degree of accuracy
 
least squares regression analysis cohen et al 1993 was used to compare genotype and motor performance the ogg1 and hdhq150q150 genotypes could affect overall performance represented by different intercepts the ogg1 and hdhq150q150 genotypes could also interact in affecting performance and potentially include six separate intercepts six separate age effects and all their interactions in addition to covariates to simplify the model we included separate intercepts for each genotype in a model that included sex and separate age effects for each hdhq150q150 genotype this allowed us to combine certain genotypicspecific intercepts and age effects into a simpler form that included three intercepts and a regression slope for age values were expressed as mean  standard error of the mean sem unless otherwise stated pvalues were obtained from the unpaired twotailed students ttest
 
statistical analyses of means for three or more groups were performed using oneway analysis of variance anova with the categories of genotype and age as independent factors followed by the newmankeuls posthoc test for multiple comparison for analyses of means involving only two groups with a sample size n30 the ftest was used to determine whether the variances between the two groups were significantly different for samples with a significant difference in variance the welchs ttest was applied students ttest was applied for the samples n  30 with an insignificant difference in variance the significance level was set at zero point zero five for all analyses all statistical computations were carried out using prism graphpad software

the anthropometric traits examined are body mass index bmi kgm2 which is a measure of body mass and a surrogate for total body fat and waisttohipratio adjusted for bmi whradjbmi which is a measure of body fat distribution traits were transformed before analyses we first created age and bmi adjusted residuals including age and age2 into the regression for bmi and additionally bmi for whradjbmi for each of the four strata separately men 50y men 50y women 50y and women 50y and subsequently applied an inverse normal transformation
 
we included up to ninetytwo studies totalling up to 21989 men 50y 74324 men 50y 41386 women 50y and 88625 women 50y with genomewide genotyping chip data using either affymetrix or illumina arrays to enable metaanalyses across different snp panels each study group performed genotype imputation using hapmap ii ceu build twentyone or 22 via mach 63 impute 64 or bimbam 65 yielding 28 million snps in addition we included twentytwo studies up to 28106 18877 29306 17872 individuals for each of the strata respectively for bmi and whradjbmi that were genotyped using the custom iselect metabochip array containing 195k snps designed to support largescale followup of putative associations with metabolic and cardiovascular traits 66
 
in each study snp associations were tested separately by agegroup and sex men 50y men 50y women 50y and women 50y for autosomal variants the additive genetic effect for each snp on each phenotype was estimated via linear regression using mach2qtl 67 snptest 64 probabel 68 genabel 69 merlin 70 plink 71 or quicktest 72 for studies with a casecontrol design cases and controls were analysed separately see s1 s2 and s3 tables for study specific genotyping imputation analysis quality control and phenotypic descriptive information in total we gathered association data from up to ninetytwo studies with imputed gwas data and twentytwo studies genotyped on the metabochip array for bmi including up to 320485 individuals and sixtyfour studies with imputed gwas data and twenty studies genotyped on the metabochip array for whradjbmi including up to 216654 individuals
 
all studies were conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki the studies were approved by the local review boards and all study participants provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis
 
all studyspecific files were processed in the metaanalysis centers through a standardized qualitycontrol qc pipeline 73 this involved qc checks on file completeness range of test statistics allele frequencies trait transformation and population stratification as well as filtering on low quality data briefly we excluded monomorphic snps snps with mafn  three minor allele frequency multiplied by sample size imputed snps with poor imputation quality r2hat  zero point three in mach observedexpected dosage variance  zero point three in bimbam properinfo  zero point four in impute information  zero point eight in plink 64 65 67 71 genotyped snps with low callrate  95 and genotyped snps that were out of hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe pvalue testing for hwe  105 to increase the overlap in the number of snps between imputed gwas and metabochip data we transferred all snp identifiers to unique snp names consisting of chromosomal and base position eg using chr1217820132 instead of rs2820443 in the metaanalysis sex and agespecific standard errors and pvalues from each participating study were genomiccontrol gc corrected using study and strataspecific lambda factors 74 whereas the lambdas were estimated from all genomewide available snps for imputed gwas and form a subset of 4427 qtinterval snps for metabochip studies
 
generally betaestimates and standard errors were metaanalyzed using an inversevariance weighted fixed effect model as implemented in metal 75
 
we metaanalyzed effect estimates and standard errors from all available studies in each of the four strata separately yielding b m50y b m50y b f50y b f50y and se m50y se m50y se f50y se f50y by metaanalyzing b m50y and b m50y we obtained the effect and standard error for men b mse m and women b fse f similar metaanalyses yielded the age groupspecific association statistics b 50y and b 50y with standard errors se 50y and se 50y metaanalysis of all four strata provided the overall association effect estimate b overall standard error se overall and pvalue p overall a joint metaanalysis based on the pooled stratumspecific estimates was performed according to aschard et al 27
 
after the metaanalyses we performed an additional quality control step on the metaanalytic results we only included snps i being available in at least half of the maximum sample size in all strata and ii having chromosome and position annotation in dbsnp
 
our study aimed at discovering snps with 1 agedifferent effects 2 sexdifferent effects and 3 agedependent sexdifferent effects or sexdependent agedifferent effects
 
to find agedifferent genetic effects we computed agedifference pvalues p agediff by testing for difference between the age groupspecific metaanalyzed betaestimates b 50y and b 50y using tageb50yb50yse50y2se50y22ragese50yse50y
 
the correlation r age between b 50y and b 50y computed as the spearman rank correlation coefficient across all snps for bmi and whradjbmi was zero point one two three and 0049 respectively the analogous test statistic for sexdifferent effects was tsexbmbfsem2sef22rsexsemsef with corresponding pvalue p sexdiff the spearman correlation r sex was zero point one two one or zero point zero four seven for bmi and whradjbmi respectively
 
to test for the threeway interaction of age and sexdifferences we introduced for the first time a test of difference between age groups in the sexdifference which is mathematical equivalent to a test of difference between sexes in the age groupdifference using the agesexdifference statistic as tagesexbm50ybf50ybm50ybf50ysem50y2sef50y2sem50y2sef50y2 with the corresponding pvalue p agesexdiff
 
to maximize statistical power we did not split our samples artificially into discovery and replication sets but metaanalyzed all studies together and verified the absence of crossstudy heterogeneity we screened genomewide for p agediff p sexdiff and p agesexdiff for each of the two traits bmi whradjbmi these screens have ideal power to detect effects that are of opposite direction across the four strata s9 fig however searching for effects that are prominent in one or some strata but not existent or directionally consistent and less pronounced in other strata profits from an a priori filter on the overall association p overall  105 as shown previously 10 26 fig 4 the rationale behind this filter is that snps with unequal effects in the different strata have nonzero overall effect when tested in all strata combined this is true unless these effects are the same magnitude but in opposite direction ie cancel out in the combined analysis hence filtering on overall association pvalue possibly enriches our selection with snps showing interaction effects for bmi and whradjbmi 7382 and 2014 snps passed this filter
 
for each trait and for each of the six approaches p agediff p sexdiff p agesexdiff with and without a priori filtering we controlled the false discovery rate fdr at 5 to account for the multiple testing 76 importantly controlling the fdr of each single analysis at 5 implies a global fdr control at 5 for the ensemble of discoveries resulting from all the different approaches together
 
to ensure the association of none of our age or sexspecific loci were driven by ascertainment bias through inclusion of caseseries of individuals with type two diabetes or coronary artery disease we performed additional metaanalyses restricted to populationbased ie no ascertainment bias studies and compared the effectsizes between the original metaanalyses and the metaanalyses restricted to populationbased studies
 
selfreported bmi or whr may cause systematic measurement error that might lead to biased effect estimates few of our studies assessed bmi and whr by selfreport in the sense that they told study participants how to measure bmi and whr for themselves in order to ensure that the age or sexdifferences of our identified loci was not driven by the few studies that used selfreport data 13 of our one hundred and fourteen studies which may introduce bias 7779 we conducted sensitivity metaanalyses limited to studies that measured anthropometric phenotypes s5 and s8 figs
 
to illustrate the strength and characteristics of the various screens outlined we analytically computed power by scan s9 fig and for all scans combined figs 4 s10 and s11 for varying configurations of effect size combinations and directions across the four strata more specifically we assumed equally sized strata a total sample size approximately corresponding to the maximum sample size of our study and modelled three categories of snps explaining realistic fractions of the phenotypic variance ie small medium and large effects from speliotes et al 28 and from heid et al 29 the power shown in any of the heatplots was calculated based on a fixed effect in women 50y set to the known effect a fixed effect in men 50y set to 0 and varying effects in women 50y and men 50y varying from negative to positive magnitude of the known effect this strategy allowed us to depict power for most important interaction effects ie for pure sexdifference pure agedifference 1strata interaction and 3strata interaction in a single heatplot see legend of fig 4
 
to identify novel genetic association for bmi and whradjbmi we screened i the p overall gathered from a fourway metaanalysis of the stratified results and ii the p joint gathered from a fourway joint metaanalysis of the stratified results according to aschard et al 27 we used a genomewide significance level p5x108 for both approaches to correct for the multiple testing and compared the detected regions to previously established loci using a 500kb distance criterion
 
for whradjbmi we counted among the sexdifferent associations disregarding the opposite effect loci how many were significantly stronger in men or women to test whether the observed counts represent significant imbalances between sexes we compared them to the expected binomial distribution with p  05 similar exercise was done for agespecific associations for bmi
 
agegroup specific association results of the identified loci were requested for bloodpressure measures diastolic and systolic blood pressure mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure from the globalbpgen consortium 30 the provided effect size and standard error estimates for six age bins 2029 3029  7079 years were combined to derive snp x age interaction effect sizes and pvalues s6 table using metaregression 34
 
sexspecific associations of the identified loci were requested for lipid traits hdlc ldlc total cholesterol and triglycerides from the global lipids genetics consortium 31 for type two diabetes t2d from the diagram consortium32 for glycemic traits fasting insulin fasting glucose homab homair from the metaanalyses of glucose and insulinrelated traits magic consortium33personal communication and for bloodpressure measures diastolic and systolic blood pressure from the globalbpgen consortium 30 s7 s8 and s9 tables the provided men and womenspecific estimates were used to derive sexdifference pvalues
 
to further investigate the identified genetic variants in this study and to gain additional insight into their functionality and possible pleiotropic effects we searched for previous snptrait associations nearby our lead snps plink was used to find all snps within five hundred kb of any of our lead snps using one thousand genomes project pilot i genotype data from the ceph utah residents with ancestry from northern and western europe population ceu 80 81 to identify previous associations all snps within the specified regions were compared with the nhgri national human genome research institute catalog for overlap and distances between the two snps were obtained using sas version nine point two citation info below for sas and plink 82 the nhgris national human genome research institute gwas catalog contains only the top thirty most significant snptrait associations from recent gwas published results from studies with at least 100000 snps with resulting pvalues of less than p1x105 82 for previous gwas results not reported in the catalog when accessed on 10152014 additional snptrait associations were pulled from the literature and compared to our lead snps using the same plink output file to obtain distance and r2 values 8391 all previous associations within five hundred kb and with an r201 with our lead snp that reached genomewide significance in the previous publication were retained for further interrogation
 
summary statistics from a genomewide association metaanalyses previously performed by egg consortium wwweggconsortiumorg were used to examine whether the fifteen agespecific bmi loci associate with birth weight andor childhood obesity risk birth weight bw had been transformed to zscores association between each snp and the birth weight was tested using linear regression assuming an additive genetic model with sex and where available gestational age as covariables 36 in the genomewide association metaanalysis for childhood obesity risk cases were defined as having an age and sexspecific bmi  95th percentile and controls as having an age and sexspecific bmi  50th percentile in children of european ancestry snp associations were assessed in a casecontrol design assuming an additive genetic model 37
 
we compared the effect sizes for fifteen loci with age related differences in bmi for each of the age strata 50y and 50y in men and women combined with the bmi in young adults ages 1625 years 58 nine out of the fourteen studies included in the young adult analysis had overlapping samples with the current sample although the bmi measurements utilized were different ie adolescenceearly adulthood versus middleaged to older adulthood we used ttests to compare effect estimates  from the younger adults aged 1625 years a to each of our age strata 50y or 50y b adjusting for the correlation due to overlapping samples such that tdiffbabbsea2seb22rseaseb where se  standard error and r  spearman correlation coefficient between the effect estimates genomewide we calculated the spearman correlation r between our study and giant using the combined stages from both studies the significance level pvalue was based on a twotailed ttest
 
we also evaluated the fifteen bmi loci showing agedependent results from genomewide analyses with weight change across adulthood using growth curves generated from multiple measures of weight in individuals between the ages of twenty and sixtyfive years weight change trajectories were calculated by sex using age as both a random and fixed effect for each of the fifteen loci showing agedifferences in bmi we observationally compared the direction of the effect estimate in the weight change results with the direction of effect seen between our adults aged 1850 years and adults 50 years while assuming constant height across adulthood and no cohort effect between the two agegroups we hypothesized that for loci where we find a stronger effect for bmi in the adults ages 1850 years compared to adults 50 years the direction of effect estimate in the weight change data would be negative for the loci where we found a stronger effect for bmi in the adults 50 years compared to the adults ages 1850 years we hypothesized that the direction of effect estimate in the weight change data would be positive
 
we examined transcript expression of genes nearby  1mb the fortyfour identified whradjbmi snp in lymphoblastoid human cell lines available in 2360 human samples from the egcut and groningen cohorts 910 women and 1450 men 39 40 we computed sexspecific associations between each of the fortyfour variants and all genes in their 1mb vicinity and tested the men and womenspecific eqtls for sexdifference fdr sexdiff5 calculated withwithout initial filter on overall expression effect fdr overall20
 
we next examined whether the fifteen snps identified to be agedependently associated with bmi impact nearby  1mb transcripts differently in younger 50y than in older individuals 50y as such we analyzed human whole blood transcription in 3489 unrelated individuals from nesda and ntr cohorts 42 43 which were divided in a 50y group n  958 and a 50y group n  2531 ciseqtl analysis for the fifteen snps was conducted for the two groups separately and agegroup specific eqtls were compared for agedifference fdr agediff5 calculated withwithout initial filter on overall expression effect fdr overall20
 
we performed a microarray analysis on data from an experiment previously published 44 briefly twentyone male twentyone female and twentyone ovariectomized ovx female c57bl6 mice were fed from day twentyone for twelve weeks on an high fat diet 45 calories from fat research diets inc new brunswick nj all mice male female and ovx were exposed to sham or ovx surgery animals were sacrificed and tissues collected during the first 2h of the beginning of the light cycle after a 12h fast
 
genechip microarray affymetrix santa clara ca was performed according to manufacturers instructions on seven independent pooled samples 3 mice per pooled sample per experimental group male female ovx from gonadal adipose tissue gwat and inguinal adipose tissue iwat fat pads amc project report version twelve 62707 genechip operating system parameters 1 and 2 were set to zero point zero five and 0065 respectively normalized expression values from the affymetrix identifier were analyzed with the online software server genesifter vizx labs inc seattle wa usa for comparisons of microarray data sets multiple ttests were used to identify genes with at least a twofold difference in gene expression with benjamini and hochberg correction p005 and at least an expression level of one hundred point genes populated from the gwas studies were compared to this list of genes that met the minimum criteria of expression fold difference and pvalue those identified as being statistically significant were further validated by qpcr
 
we used a recently developed pathway enrichment method depict 47 the methodology first selects all lead snps below a certain threshold with respect to a target pvalue available genomewide we tested multiple hypotheses corresponding to different lead snp selection scenarios first we selected snps with p sexdiff 0001 second focusing on snps with concordant effect size direction ced but different magnitude we added a marginal filter to boost power by selecting snps with p sexdiff 001 and p overall 001 in case of ced snps with stronger effect in women may fall into separate pathways from snps with stronger effect in men hence we have derived genderspecific sexdifference pvalues psexdifff psexdiffm we then looked for womenspecific pathway enrichment by selecting snps with psexdifff 001 and p overall 001 given the ced framework similarly we created a separate list for menspecific snps by a filter of psexdiffm 001 and p overall 001 all above lists were also created for agedependent bmi associations by replacing psexdiff by pagediff psexdifff by pagediffyounger and psexdiffm by pagediffolder
 
for each of the eight snp lists leads snps were identified for each lead snp locus a target region is defined as the smallest interval containing all snps with ld05 with the lead snp of the locus all genes encompassed in the target regions represent the gwas genes thereby assuming that either the lead snp is in ld with a functional coding snp within a gene or that the lead snp marks a cisacting regulatory region we then used the following predefined gene sets and pathways gene ontology go reactome inweb protein complexes mouse knockout phenotypes gene sets were reannotated based on coexpression in a large collection 80000 of gene expression compendium from geo then for each geneset the pairwise similarity between gwas genes was calculated and compared to that of matching sets of nongwas genes to assess significance of enrichment
 
depict also generated a prioritized set of genes at each locus briefly genes within associated loci that are functionally similar to genes from other associated loci are the more likely candidates depict prioritizes genes in three steps gene scoring bias adjustment and false discovery rate estimation in the scoring step the method quantifies the similarity of a given gene to genes from other associated loci the bias adjustment step controls confounding factors that may bias the gene scores eg gene length in the last step experimentwide false discovery rates are estimated by repeating the scoring and bias adjustment steps twenty times based on top snps from precomputed null gwas
 
significantly associated loci were further explored using qiagens ingenuity pathway analysis ipa qiagen redwood city wwwqiagencomingenuity to determine if there was an overarching functional or disease relationship among these loci and their associated genes using the age and sex specific snp lists described above ipa uses publicly available databases eg nhgri gwas catalog ncbi databases kegg and proprietary databases of geneprotein interaction expression and function to identify possible pathways networks and overlapping functions of genes for our analysis ipa identified potential genes as those genes with coding regions within 2kb upstream or 05kb downstream of our list of input dbsnp ids that can unambiguously be mapped to these ids to perform the analyses only ingenuity knowledge base genes were used both direct and indirect relationships that are observed or predicted in mammals humans mice and rats are strictly considered all canonical pathways and functionaldisease categories and annotations that were statistically significant p  zero point zero five using the fishers exact test are reported however those that meet significance for multiple test correction benjaminhochberg corrected p 005 are highlighted in the table only the top ten predicted networks containing up to one hundred and forty genes or endogenous molecules were requested only those networks with a score of greater than two fishers exact test result of p 001 are considered significant 92
 
we estimated the broad heritability h2 of bmi and whradjbmi within the family heart study fhs to assess how much of each traits total phenotypic variance may be genetic a random sample of 1810 individuals 454 families was used for this analysis the sample was stratified by age and sex into nine groups all all 50y all 50y men women men 50y men 50y women 50y women 50y to assess how each traits genetic variance may differ across strata within each group bmi and whradjbmi were adjusted for age age2 genotyping chips illumina 560k 1000000k 610k ten principal components and three study centers residuals for bmi and whradjbmi were ranked and an inverse normal transformation was applied subsequently solar was used to estimate the h2 of bmi and whradjbmi within each group s28 table
 
to explore the contribution of all common genotyped snps genomewide to each trait of interest bmi and whradjbmi we estimated the variance explained by all the autosomal snps in the combined aric kora s3s4 colaus egcut and ship studies within each of the sex and age strata using the method proposed by yang et al 93 and implemented in the genomewide complex trait analysis software package gcta  each phenotypic trait was transformed in the same form as was used for all metaanalyses
 
we estimated the agegroup and sexspecific polygenic variance explained by various subsets of snps that were based on varying thresholds of overall association poverall with bmi or whradjbmi first each subset of snps was clumped into independent regions using a physical distance criterion 500kb and for each region the most significantly overall associated snp ie top snp was taken further for each top snp the explained variance was calculated according to r211n1p221r2n for each agegroup and for each sex separately 94 finally the variance explained by the subset of snps was obtained by summing up the single snpspecific explained variances the overall association threshold was varied from 1x108 to 01
 
we examined whether snps known to provide reliable tags for copynumbervariations cnvs in subjects of europeandescent combining four catalogues including 60167 cnvtagging snps as described previously 95 correlated with our lead snps we also performed several online database searches to establish whether known variants within a 500kbwindow on both sides of each lead snp that are in high linkage disequilibrium r2  08 with our lead snps using snap proxy search 96 might have putative or predicted function i we searched the sift database 97 to determine whether any of these snps were predicted to affect protein function ii we used annovar 98 to investigate predicted and putative function in several functional classes including splicing regulation stop codons polyphen predictions iii we used the regulome database  to search for known and predicted regulatory elements dnaase hypersensitivity binding sites of transcription factors and promoter regions in the intergenic regions of our agespecific bmi and sexspecific whradjbmi loci additionally we searched for estrogen androgen or progesterone receptor motifs around our sexspecific whradjbmi loci source of these data include public datasets from geo the encode project and published literature 99

to infer recombination events and compare sex differences we extracted a total of 185917 threegeneration families from a large pedigree of holstein cattle maintained in the animal genomics and improvement laboratory agil at usda with one offspring both parents and two grandsires with snp genotypes in each family fig 1 in each of the 185917 families we inferred recombination events for a paternal meiosis from the sireoffspring pair and a maternal meiosis from the damoffspring pair for recombination map construction and gwas of hotspot usage we only included the highestquality or most informative meioses where the offspring the parent and the grandsire were genotyped by 50k snp chips resulting in a total of 70715 male and 61616 female meioses for gwas analysis of genomewide recombination rate we included all paternal and maternal meioses from the 185917 families regardless of the number of snps genotyped
 
the animals in the selected families were genotyped by various genotyping assays s1 table ranging from 3k to 770k snps 33 the illumina bovinesnp50 v1 chip with 56947 snps v2 chip with 54609 snps the highdensity hd chip with 777962 snps and the geneseek hd chip with 77068 snps are referred to as the 50k chip as we used a combined set of 50k snps 65 the zoetis bovineld chip with 10555 snps the geneseek genomic profiler v1 and v2 chips with 8042 and 8415 snps the illumina bovineld beadchip with 6785 snps the illumina bovine3k beadchip with 2708 snps are referred to herein as 10k 8k 7k and 3k respectively the chips were designed as mostly nested with the higherdensity chip including snps on the lowerdensity ones although the offspring and two parents were genotyped by various snp chips the grandsires were mostly genotyped by the 50k snp chips note that the granddam was not necessarily genotyped in the selected threegeneration families depending on the number of genotyped granddams we collected 67690 76318 and 41909 families with two one and zero genotyped granddams respectively note that an animal may appear in more than one family based on the pedigree structure especially for bulls that have hundreds of progeny
 
to study recombination we included up to 59309 genomewide snps after quality control filtering and used the usdaagil snp coordinates that showed a higher quality than the umd31 assembly 3033 previously several snps were relocated from the umd31 assembly to the usdaaigl coordinates in cooperation with researchers from the university of missouri r d schnabel and the university of guelph m sargolzaei and j johnston from pairwise linkage analysis in this study we also removed nine suspicious snps that exhibited suspicious linkage disequilibrium ld patterns with snps on the same chromosome s2 fig and s3 table due to the low quality of the genome assembly we excluded the x chromosome from recombination calculation in this study
 
to compare sex differences on an equal footing we phased the raw genotypes for the paternal and maternal meioses within a threegeneration family without using the possible additional information from multiple offspring 66 because bulls generally had many more progeny than cows in each of the threegeneration families we inferred the paternal and maternal haplotypes of the offspring based on the genotypes of the two parents and also inferred the paternal and maternal haplotypes for both parents based on the genotypes of the grandparents 2966 homozygous genotypes were phased trivially and the heterozygous genotypes were phased whenever the genotypes of the two parents are not heterozygous simultaneously the parentoforigin was then assigned to each allele after phasing to determine paternal and maternal haplotypes
 
after phasing the genotypes of the offspring and parents we inferred recombination events in the paternal and maternal haplotypes of the offspring by comparing the offsprings paternal haplotype to the two haplotypes of the sire as well as by comparing the offsprings maternal haplotype to the two haplotypes of the dam in the offspring haplotype a recombination event was defined as a transition from the parents paternal to maternal haplotype or vice versa note that the recombination events defined here were observed crossovers so that the number of observed crossovers could differ from the number of true crossovers when multiple crossover events occurred at the same site this potential inconsistency between observed and true crossovers typically is addressed by a map function that translates a recombination frequency into a map distance in terms of crossovers however the physical distances between two adjacent snps were small so that the use of a map function virtually would not make a numerical difference therefore our estimates of crossovers based on recombinants should be close to the true number of underlying crossovers to further reduce false positives we required a crossover call to be supported by at least three consecutive informative heterozygous snps 9 in total we identified 45 million paternal and 40 million maternal recombination events from the total of 185917 paternal and maternal meioses respectively to ensure that our results do not depend strongly on the cutoffs we repeated the analysis by using a different cutoff value of five consecutive informative markers and the number of identified crossovers was only reduced by 02
 
a recombination event was assigned to a region spanned by two informative snps that may not be adjacent to each other to construct a recombination map we used an emalgorithm to calculate the probability of crossing over per meiosis or recombination rate between each pair of consecutive snps based on the observed crossover regions 9 after an initiation step to assign an expected count of 1m to each of the m adjacent snp intervals in a crossover region the em algorithm proceeded in the following iteration steps 1 mstep considering a total of n meioses the overall expected count attributed to a snp interval divided by n were the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability and 2 estep for a crossover region the expected count assigned to a snp interval was estimated as proportional to the current estimate of the probability of crossover for that snp interval the m and e steps were iterated until convergence
 
we constructed the male and female recombination maps for 59309 autosomal snps based on 18 million paternal and 14 million maternal recombination crossovers which were identified from 70715 male and 61616 female meioses that are most informative where the offspring the parent and the grandsire were genotyped by 50k snp chips note that some granddams were genotyped by a low density chip or even not genotyped as described earlier a correction for the number of snps of the granddam was employed in the two sexes separately such that the total number of crossovers after correction was the same regardless of the snp numbers for granddams we used the expected number of crossovers per meiosis or recombination rate between adjacent snps as the genetic distance in our recombination map since one crossover event on average corresponds to a genetic distance of one morgan and recombination rate is almost the same as genetic distance for small intervals 967 alternatively using haldanes map function with crossover interference 68 the male and female maps were slightly longer twentyfive point six and twentythree point three morgans in length respectively
 
we defined recombination hotspots as the snp intervals with a recombination rate 25 standard deviations from the genomewide average in males and females separately because two point five standard deviations are highly significant departures from the average recombination in cattle given our large sample sizes in both sexes consistent with the observations from a recent recombination study in cattle 29 we tested a range of cutoff values 2 25 3 5 and ten standard deviations and found that the cutoff value of two point five standard deviations showed the clearest signal for the association between prdm9 and recombination hotspot usage for validation purposes we also defined recombination hotspots via using a standardized recombination rate that was calculated by dividing the original recombination rate between two snps by the physical length after this adjustment of physical lengths the standard recombination rates vary even less so we used a cutoff value of zero point six standard deviations to define recombination hotspots
 
to ensure the quality of the hotspots identified we calculated pairwise linkage disequilibrium ld statistics between each of the snps in or near a recombination hotspot and all other snps on the same chromosome using locusmap 35 the pairwise ld was evaluated by a lod score and an estimated recombination rate for a snp with correct physical position the lod scores should peak near the snp and decrease when moving away in the two directions the recombination rate should follow the opposite pattern with small values near the snp and increasing with the distance any obvious deviations from these expected ld patterns suggest a possible error in the snp coordinate and thus a false recombination hotspot s2 fig nine suspicious snps exhibiting unexpected ld patterns together with seven originally identified recombination hotspots were removed s5 table
 
as expected the power for identifying recombination events was affected by the number of genotyped snps for male meiosis the average number of crossovers identified varied from twentyfive point nine to seventeen point seven depending on the number of measured snps of the animals in a threegeneration family s2 table overall more crossovers were identified when the number of snps increased except for a few categories that had a small sample size and thus large noise a similar pattern was also observed for female meioses where the number of crossovers ranged between twentythree point nine and sixteen point zero s3 table to account for this effect of snp numbers we used the highestquality meioses where all animals were genotyped by 50k snp chip as a reference to correct the number of crossovers identified in other meioses after correction the average number of crossovers was equal to twentyfive point five in males and twentythree point two in females
 
to evaluate the power for identifying crossovers using 50k snp genotypes we simulated 50k snp genotypes for all animals in the real pedigree and used the same phasing and crossover identification procedures as described in previous sections by defining a positive result as an identified crossover interval overlapping with the true location of a crossover we calculated the power of crossover identification as the proportion of positive results across all simulated crossover events as a result our approach had a power of 976 for the threegeneration families genotyped by 50k snp chip which means that on average only 24 crossovers were missed in our recombination map
 
to evaluate the relationship between recombination features and potentially related factors we fitted a smooth spline model of the male and female recombination rates on relative chromosomal locations or time using the smoothspline function implemented in r 311 69 we calculated a relative physical position for each of the snp intervals by dividing the original physical position by the corresponding chromosome length for the analysis of chromosome location effect on recombination we used those meioses for which all the required individuals were genotyped by 50k snp chip and removed 2mb regions to the end of all chromosomes where the power of identifying crossovers is low 9 for the analysis of time trend we used all the meioses and adjusted for the effects of snp chips and inbreeding as well as effect of influential bulls by accounting for the number of progeny for bulls specifically the correction was conducted with a linear model for the number of crossovers by fitting fixed effects for the categories of snp chips of the offspring parent and two grandparents genomic inbreeding coefficient of the parent the number of phased heterozygous snps of the offspring and parent quadratic and cubic terms of the two numbers of informative snps and the interaction terms between them as expected we found a negative association between inbreeding coefficient and number of recombination events in both sexes males   028 and pvalue  0006 females   011 and pvalue  three point two  1012 to investigate the common pattern across the twentynine autosomes we pooled all the autosomes together using the relative physical position and fitted a smooth spline model for all the data combined fig 4 we also fitted a smooth spline model for each of the chromosomes individually s3 fig a degree of freedom of five was used in all the smooth spline modeling a similar smooth spline model was fitted for the analysis of time trend of recombination rate and hotspot usage s8 s9 s10 and s12 figs
 
we estimated the number of recombination events for maternal and paternal meioses in each of the 185917 threegeneration families which were then assigned to the sire and dam in the family each sire or dam may have multiple phenotypic measurements when appearing in more than one family and we calculated the average of the multiple measurements as the phenotype for genomewide recombination rate a total of 3224 bulls and 53125 cows were included in the gwas of genomewide recombination rate we corrected the originally estimated number of recombination events by the number of measured snps of the animals for each meiosis so that the average number of crossovers was the same regardless of the genotyping assays s2 and s3 tables
 
we calculated the genomewide proportions of crossovers occurring in the hotspots ie hotspot usage for the 70715 male and 61616 female meioses that are most informative where the offspring the parent and the grandsire were genotyped by 50k snp chips after assigning the estimated hotspot usage to the sire or dam for each meiosis we used the average of the multiple measurements as the phenotype resulting in a sample size of 1772 and 12756 in males and females respectively
 
imputed genotypes of 777962 snps on the illumina bovinehd genotyping beadchip hd were obtained by running findhap on measured genotypes with 3k to 50k snp chips using a reference population of 2433 animals directly measured with hd snp chips 3370 after filtering snps exhibiting redundancy very high linkage disequilibrium r  095 or small minor allele frequency maf  0001 we retained over 310k genomewide snps in the association studies 33
 
we tested for association between each snp and a phenotype using a linear mixed model with variable residual variances that are inversely proportional to the number of repeated measures of the phenotype ie residual variance is smaller for individuals with more measurements of the phenotype the model equation in matrix notation is yxgzae where y  a vector of the phenotype x  a design matrix of the fixed effects g including a population mean and the additive effect of the candidate snp z  a design matrix for a random animal effect a and e  a vector of random residuals we assume that a  n0aa2 and e  n0re2 where a is the genomic relationship matrix and r is a diagonal matrix with the ith diagonal element equal to 1w where w is the number of phenotypic measurements for the ith animal
 
this model has been implemented in the mmap software package with optimized computing 7172 which can finish a gwas analysis with 53125 samples and 310k snps in hours using thirtytwo cpu cores of the highperformance computer at usdaagil the model was empirically validated by observing no inflation in the quantilequantile plots qqplot of the gwas pvalues for both recombination rate and hotspot usage in this study s5 and s6 figs

malassezia was grown on mdixon media for dna extraction and m globosa was grown on mdixon or minimal media for rna extraction sequencing was done using illumina hiseq two thousand point please see s9 text for details
 
genomes were assembled using an inhouse pipeline specifically we used a conservative trimming approach removing q2 bases and all following bases and discarding pairedend reads with one or both ends shorter than fifty bp as recommended by illumina after readtrimming de novo assemblies contiging and scaffolding were constructed using soapdenovo 51 version 105 maximum insert length  300bp a range of assembly options were explored including testing various kmers 41 51 61 71 81 and downsampling of coverage on an exponential scale down to 50x to identify an optimal assembly in terms of contiguity statistics n50 an example of this can be seen in s6 table the resulting assembly was then rescaffolded using the program opera version one point four 52 with default parameters and we attempted to close remaining gaps in the assembly in silico using finis 53 details of assembly statistics can be found in s7 table
 
illumina pairedend reads were first trimmed using fastqqualitytrimmer t twenty l 10 in fastx  reads that could not be paired were discarded then reads were assembled into transcripts using trinity 54 jaccardclipsslibtype fr the jaccardclip option was turned on to avoid fusion of transcripts assembly was done individually for each sample and all assemblies were combined to generate a complete set of 727354 transcripts after removing redundant transcripts that were identical to another transcript a total of 716864 transcripts were left then transcripts that were fully contained in another transcript were also removed to generate a set of 402757 transcripts
 
the m globosa seven thousand nine hundred and sixtysix reference genome was originally annotated by combining in silico prediction and a limited number of est sequences 2 therefore we reannotated this genome to improve quality with the aid of rnaseq datasets from two growth conditions and the application of newer ab initio gene prediction programs 5556 we used the maker pipeline 57 to integrate ab initio gene prediction snap 55 and augustus 56 transcript evidence from our rnaseq dataset and protein evidence to predict genes in an iterative manner for protein sequences we downloaded several fungal genomes from genbank including saccharomyces cerevisiae 58 ustilago maydis 59 candida albicans 60 m globosa 2 and m sympodialis 14 the protein sequences of m globosa and m sympodialis were not used in their own annotation process respectively four sets of annotation were generated using the maker pipeline 57 in an iterative manner to improve ab initio gene prediction first maker was run with protein evidence and ab initio predictors trained with core eukaryotic genes predicted by cegma 20 then maker was rerun twice additionally for each time ab initio predictors were retrained with gene models predicted by the previous run
 
the first annotation was generated without transcripts compared to the reference annotation this annotation retrieved longer genes and identified more exons and introns the number of pfam domains identified in this annotation was slightly higher than that of the reference annotation suggesting that it annotation captured more sequences with coding potential the number of supported intronexon junctions also increased indicating that a large portion of the newly identified junctions were likely real s2 table 1st set these results suggest that even without transcript evidence our annotation captured more coding sequences and more complete genes upon addition of transcript evidence in the second set the number of introns increased while the number of genes decreased likely due to the false merging of genes by transcripts spanning two genes s2 table 2nd set since the m globosa genome is compact with 4223 genes table 1 in a nine point zero mbp genome false merging of genes during transcriptome assembly is likely the number of pfam domains in the protein sequences also decreased therefore we removed any transcript that overlapped with two or more gene models in order to generate the third annotation set s2 table 3rd set the full set of transcripts was aligned to the m globosa reference genome using blat with minimum identity of 99 61 and any transcript that overlapped with more than one gene model were removed to generate the reduced set of transcripts this reduced the transcript set from 402757 transcripts to 322251 transcripts we also noted that very few genes exhibited evidence for alternatives isoforms 10 with two isoforms and one with four isoforms then gene models in the second set that do not overlap with any gene in the third set were added to generate the fourth annotation set s2 table 4th set adding these transcripts led to an increased number of supported junctions but the number of unique pfam domains and total pfam domains did not increase further s2 table suggesting that ab initio prediction is sufficient to capture sequences with coding potential for genomes other than m globosa 7966 we used the same iterative approach for annotation without transcript evidence
 
species trees were constructed using the concatenated sequences of one hundred and sixtyfour core eukaryotic genes cegs predicted by cegma 20 that are present in all malassezia genomes u maydis genome and the s cerevisiae genome and the malassezia sequences are at least 90 the length of their s cerevisiae orthologs sequences were aligned using muscle 62 and the phylogeny was constructed using maximum likelihood ml approaches as implemented by raxml 63 raxml was run using f a m protgammajtt with four hundred bootstraps ustilaginomycotina tree was built using the same approach to test the robustness of our malassezia phylogeny beyond bootstrap values we applied a bayesian approach on the same concatenated sequences using mrbayes 64 mrbayes was run using prset aamodelpr  mixed and mcmc nchains  one ngen  300000 we also merged individual ml gene trees for cegs into a supertree 65 individual gene trees were constructed using the same approach and they were merged into a supertree using clann 65 using this approach more genes could be incorporated into the final tree as missing a strain in a gene tree could be tolerated both approaches yielded the same phylogeny as the concatenated ml tree bayesian tree in s3a fig we also generated a species tree derived from the mitochondrial genomes jack kennell personal communications s3b fig despite differences observed on an intraspecies level within the m furfur m globosa and m sympodialis lineages we found that the two trees correspond perfectly on an interspecies level
 
for m furfurspecific tree s1 fig mcl clusters described later with two genes in each of the hybrids m furfur 7710 m furfur 1878 m furfur 4172 and m furfur 7019 and one gene in each of the haploids m furfur seven thousand nine hundred and eightytwo and m furfur jplk23 were used nucleotide sequences were used instead of amino acid sequences the genes from hybrid strains were separated into two groups based on their similarity to the genes of the two haploid strains as measured by blast bitscore 39 only clusters with less than 5 of total alignment as indels were used to minimize the effect of assembly and annotation errors a total of 1306 clusters were concatenated and aligned using muscle 62 to generate a maximum likelihood tree raxml was used with f a  four hundred m gtrgamma 63
 
pfam domains 29 were identified in all malassezia strains and other fungal protein sequences using hmmscan hmmer 31b1 with trusted cutoffs  malasseziaspecific pfam domains are defined as present in at least seven malassezia species and in at most two other fungi this approach is limited to the study of protein families having at least one pfam domain mcl clustering 66 was used to cluster malassezia and other fungal genes based on their pairwise sequence similarity to construct gene families this approach does not rely on pfam and can include all genes regardless whether they have pfam domains or not yet unrelated genes with no orthology can be clustered together if they both have a good match to a third gene blast 39 was used to align malassezia and other fungal protein sequences in an allagainstall fashion with an evalue cutoff of 105 mcl was used to cluster protein sequences based on their evalues withi 20 sequences shorter than 90 of the median length in the cluster were excluded malasseziaspecific clusters were defined as present in at least seven malassezia species and not present in other fungi to infer gain and loss in pfam families pfam family phylogenies were constructed using muscle and raxml as described earlier then species phylogeny and gene family phylogenies were reconciled using notung 67 to infer gain and loss events that took place along the malassezia phylogeny
 
for selection tests we choose singleton pfam families in malassezia species protein sequences were first aligned using muscle described earlier and nucleotides were then substituted back in the sequences paml 68 was used for selection tests codeml m7 m8 mode and genes with bonferronicorrected pvalue  zero point zero five were tabulated 2 test two degrees of freedom
 
for malassezia growth in 2x ynb media cultures were incubated in 2x ynb at 31c for 24 48 72 and one hundred and fortyfour hours four strains m furfur 7982 m sympodialis 42132 m pachydermatis one thousand eight hundred and seventynine and seven thousand five hundred and fifty also named by cbs  were used for each strain two cultures one with and one without tween forty at 1 were included in this experiment
 
two separate methods were used to extract lipids from the bactopeptone media please refer to s9 text for details
 
briefly sabouraud broth was melted with 3 sea plaque gtg lowmelt agarose and equilibrated to 45c malassezia cells were counted and diluted to 1x105 cellsml in sabouraud broth with chloramphenicol and equilibrated to 31c cell suspension 30ml and melted agar broth 30ml were quickly mixed and poured into one hundred and fifty mm dishes once solidified eighteen holes were made with a two mm punch biopsy to each hole five l of test compound was added and the plates were incubated for seventeen days at 34c test compounds are listed in s5 and s6 tables please refer to 6970 for artificial sebum
 
we examined the two mating type loci pr and hd for all malassezia species we used the gene sequences from the reference strains for m sympodialis and m globosa as queries to blast 39 against the genome assemblies of all malassezia species to identify the locations of the mat loci in these genomes the alignments of mat loci between malassezia species were generated through webact  using blastn with an evalue cutoff of 00001
 
m sympodialis fortytwo thousand one hundred and thirtytwo protein sequences were compared to uniprotkb v201502 71 and the ncbi nucleotide collection database using ncbi blast 72 proteins with the most significant blast hit against bacteria in both databases were analyzed further bacterial and fungal homologs of each hgt candidate were retrieved from genbank 73 multiple sequence alignments were generated using muscle v3831 62 poorly aligned or divergent regions in the alignments were identified and excluded from further analysis using gblocks v091 with options u  y t  p 74 phylogenetic trees and one thousand bootstraps for each alignment were generated using phyml v20120412 with options m jtt d aa 75 phylogenetic trees were manually inspected and candidate horizontally transferred genes were chosen if they were closer relatives to their bacterial orthologs than their fungal orthologs
 
we used pathoscope two point zero 76 to estimate the abundances of the fourteen malassezia species in different shotgun metagenomics datasets strain seven thousand nine hundred and eightytwo used for m furfur strain seven thousand eight hundred and seventyseven for m restricta strain seven thousand nine hundred and sixtysix for m globosa and strain fortytwo thousand one hundred and thirtytwo for m sympodialis before mapping to the reference genomes the reads were filtered against a set of nonmalassezia fungal genomes all fungal genomes from ftpftpncbinlmnihgovgenomesfungi plus ustilago maydis 59 using pathoscope 20s map module to further account for potential false positives from pathoscope analysis malassezia genomes were divided into one kb bins and a species was considered present only if 10 of the bins were covered by at least one read abundances of malassezia species were renormalized after removing false positives using this filter the performance of pathoscope two point zero was benchmarked by mapping the original reads of each malassezia strain to the genomes of all malassezia species using the protocol described here

lasso and enet penalized regression methods are applied to highdimensional problems with a large number of parameters the penalization produces a shrinkage of the regression coefficients towards zero given a sparse model reducing the irrelevant parameters both methods deal with highly correlated variables though in a different way lasso tends to select one variable from a group of correlated features whereas enet selects the whole group of variables when evidence for their relevance exists the shrunk estimators introduce a bias while reducing the variance resulting in a better precision and accuracy model and therefore increasing its statistical power
 
consider the standard linear regression model where y  y 1 y nt is the response variable and x  x 1j x njt j  1 p are the standardized predictors the lasso solves the l one penalized regression problem the ridge regression 23 solves the l two penalized regression problem and the enet is the combination between the l one and l two penalized regression problem
 
for the lasso and enet estimates 01pt 0 are defined by 0argmini1nyi0j1pjxij2 with the restrictions j1pjtlasso1 j1pjtj1pj2tenet2
 
here t  zero is the tuning parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage that is applied to the estimates for j0 the unpenalized least squares estimate t0j0 values of t  t zero will lead to shrinkage towards 0 some coefficients may be exactly equal to zero point
 
using the lagrangian form this optimization problem is equivalent to lasso lassoargmin1ni1nyixi2j1pj3 where  is the penalty parameter related to t to obtain the optimal penalty kfold cross validation cv was applied 24 maximizing the penalized loglikelihood function
 
enet enetargmin1ni1nyixi21j1pj2j1pj24 where 1 2 are the penalty parameters related to t in this sense enet can be viewed as a penalized least squares method with    2 one   2 solving enet in eq 4 is equivalent to the following optimization problem enetargmin1ni1nyixi21j1pjj1pj25
 
this expression involves a convex combination of the lasso and ridge penalty when   one the enet becomes ridge regression and when  0 the enet becomes lasso to obtain the optimal penalty  kfold cv selecting the best  was applied this value was obtained using a vector of  001 099 by 001
 
the lasso and enet methods described above were applied to our data with the r package glmnet that relies on cyclical coordinate descent computed along a regularization path 25 to avoid small sample size limitations in variable selection while not introducing an important bias k  five was used in the kfold cv
 
these methods are promising in the context of highthroughput data but one of their drawbacks is that they do not provide pvalues to assess statistical significance of relationships nor give a formal assessment of the overall goodnessoffit therefore a permutation based strategy was adopted to assess significance of discovered relationships combined with a mt correction approach maxt algorithm 22 building upon the statistical concept of deviance the deviance is used to compare two models and in this case we defined it as deviance2loglikfullmodellogliknullmodel
 
here loglik is the loglikelihood function full model refers to the model with the parameters selected by lasso or enet and null model is the model with only the intercept estimated thus the interpretation would be the higher the deviance the better the model
 
maxt algorithm of westfall  young 22 is a stepdown fwercontrolling mt procedure the method uses the raw pvalues or directly the statistics as explained in 26 using this approach the permutation needed to obtain the pvalues was combined with the one needed to apply the maxt algorithm saving computational time in this work we used the deviance obtained per each of the permuted lassoenet model to compute the maxt algorithm and individuals within gene expression measure were permuted that is the dependent variable in the models the algorithm is explained in box one point

seventy patients with a histologically confirmed ubc were recruited in two hospitals during 19971998 as part of the pilot phase of the spanish bladder cancerepicuro study according to established criteria based on tumor stage and grade for ubc the tumors were classified as lowgrade nonmuscle invasive highgrade nonmuscle invasive and muscle invasive three sets of omics data were obtained using fresh tumor tissue including common genetic variation gse51641 dna methylation gse71666 and gene expression gse71576 the three omics data overlapped in twentyseven individuals that are included in this study and comprise 44 lowgrade nonmuscle invasive tumors 30 highgrade nonmuscle invasive tumors and 26 muscle invasive tumors s1 table shows the ids of the twentyseven samples used in the following analysis the local ethics committee of the participating centers approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the time of recruitment
 
genotyping of tumor samples was performed using illumina humanhap 1m array a total of 1047101 snps were determined in fortysix individuals and after the standard quality control and filter the snps that were in perfect ld r two  1 they resulted in 567513 snps the application of multivariable models required no missing values so genotypes were imputed with beagle three point zero method 27 cpg methylation data was generated using the infinium human methylation twentyseven beadchip kit at each cpg site the methylation levels were measured with mvalues using the log2 transformation of the values since they are more statistically valid due to a better approximation of the homoscedasticity the initial number of cpgs in the studied array was 27578 and after background normalization and qc a total number of 23034 cpgs were left for analysis gene expression data were obtained from fortyfour tumor samples using the affymetrix dna microarray human gene one point zero st array with 32321 probes after the application of qc it resulted in 20899 probes determined in thirtyseven individuals further details about the preprocessing of the data and the quality control applied can be found elsewhere 12 the three measures were annotated using the ucsc hg19 ncbi build thirtyseven to make them comparable and homogenize their position in the genome
 
to generate a simulation sample the association between snps andor cpgs with gene expression was broken and therefore no significant results should be observed to do that 10gene expression probes were randomly selected from our discovery sample showing no correlation structure between the probes and following a multivariate normal distribution then the mean   84 and variance 2  04 of all the probes together were obtained finally a simulated set of gene expression probes was generated using the normal distribution obtained and considering the same sample size of the discovery phase p  20899 probes and n  twentyseven individuals
 
ubc tumor data were obtained from the cancer genome atlas tcga consortium  to replicate our findings data was downloaded and processed with the tcgaassembler 28 the study included only individuals with muscle invasive ubc and the tumors were profiled with genome wide six point zero affymetrix rnaseqv2 and humanmethylation450k illumina arrays yielding data for 20502 gene expression probes 905422 snps and 350271 cpgs the total number of individuals with overlapping data from the three platforms was two hundred and thirtyeight and they were used in the replication phase of this contribution s2 table shows the ids corresponding to these two hundred and thirtyeight samples
 
penalized regression methods lasso and enet were applied to the discovery data in combination with the proposed permutationbased maxt method to select the snps andor cpgs associated with gene expression levels in the following multivariable models
 
snp model geneexpressionlevelsi1snp12snp2psnppi1m
 
cpg model geneexpressionlevelsi1cpg12cpg2pcpgpi1m
 
global model  snp  cpg model geneexpressionlevelsi1snp1psnpp1cpg1pcpgpi1m
 
to apply this integrative idea to our set of data the following steps were performed 1 snps and cpgs that were in a 1mb window upstream and downstream were selected from each probe in the gene expression array 2 lasso and enet were applied to each probe and model snp cpg and global models obtaining the deviance per model and 3 the permutationbased maxt method was applied to obtain the adjusted pvalues b  one hundred permutations and significant adjusted pvalue  01 the scenario and workflow is represented in fig one point
 
the integrative framework proposed is based on three steps step one corresponds to the selection of snps and cpgs in 1mb window upstream and downstream from each probe in the gene expression array step two corresponds to the application of lasso and enet to each probe obtaining the deviance per probe step three corresponds to the permutationbased maxt method application where gene expression levels within the individuals are permuted b  one hundred times obtaining the deviance per probe
 
subsequently this analysis flow was applied to the simulated data set using the same criteria in the replication scenario we aimed at determining whether the genes that were significant in the discovery phase were also significant in the replication dataset therefore the analysis was restricted to the genes found to be significant in the discovery phase considering all models snp cpg andor global and methods lasso andor enet following the pipeline shown in fig 1 we focused on the significant genes found in the discovery phase and snps and cpgs were selected in 1mb window from the tcga database even if the snps and cpgs were not the same as those analyzed in the discovery phase second lasso andor enet were conducted to snp cpg andor global models finally the permutationbased maxt method was applied to obtain significance and correct for multiple testing the replication analysis was performed with the same software and criteria as in the discovery analysis
 
to provide a biological interpretation to the results the entire list of the significant genes identified in the discovery phase by both lasso and enet and by the three models was used to perform a gene enrichment analysis with the bioinformatics tool david 2930 the functional annotation clustering analysis module offered by david was used the gene term annotation is based on fourteen annotation categories gene ontology go biological process go molecular function go cellular component kegg pathways biocarta pathways swissprot keywords bbid pathways smart domains nih genetics association db uniprot sequence features cogkog ontology ncbi omim interpro domains and pir superfamily names collected in the david tool knowledgebase  the method identifies related genes by measuring the similarity of their global annotation profiles so the grouping term is based on the idea that two genes that have similar annotation profiles are functionally related each group term provides an enrichment score es that indicates biological significance when 13 equivalent to nonlog scale 005 david also provides a pvalue to examine the significance of geneterm enrichment which is corrected by benjamini mt 31

our study of data use conditions included 1 a review of guidance from the nih 2 a survey of data use conditions for data accessed within a large research institute the broad institute of mit and harvard and for data held within the ega 25 of the emblebi and crg and 3 consultation with the international scientific community via the global alliance data working group and with the mme project taken together these provided us with a broad overview and evidence from a large number of datasets that are representative of the field
 
the nih expects that any limitations on the research use of the data as expressed in the informed consent documents should be clearly delineated in the institutions assurance of the data submission to the dbgap of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi 26 known as the institutional certification 27 for example in some studies in dbgap a subset of research participants in a study may have provided informed consent that their data could only be used by notforprofit companies that have no interest in commercializing a product as a result of the secondary data use in an effort to provide greater consistency among the commonly used groups of limitations the nih developed a library of duls 7 in this case the nih standard dul for this subgroup of participants would be notforprofit use only to indicate that based on the original informed consent of the study participants the data can be used only by notforprofit organizations to access controlledaccess dbgap datasets researchers must submit a data access request dar which includes a proposed research use statement as well as agreement to the terms of use as described in the data use certification agreement duc and attestation to the elements in the genomic data user code of conduct the duls for each of the datasets being requested are stipulated in the request process and the final dar application the relevant data access committee dac 28 reviews the dars and its decisions are based primarily upon conformity of the proposed research as described in the dar to the duls specified by the submitting institution
 
the ega follows a similar procedure for access to the controlledaccess datasets it stores researchers requesting data apply to a given dac in order to be granted access to the controlled data 29 each dac reviews whether the applicants research purpose fits with the provided controlled data access agreement daa with the data donors a difference with dbgap is that the dac process is not centralized and each dac has its own policy for gathering the information relating to application acceptance or rejection
 
we also incorporated the findings of a research study that analyzed data use limitations in ducs and other access agreements for datasets used at the broad institute of mit and harvard this identified additional data use conditions as well as provided an estimate of their preponderance finally we also incorporated knowledge of additional data use conditions from the experience of the ega and of the members of the global alliance data working group 30 as the material we drew upon stemmed largely from experience with research datasets we also sought a clinical genetics perspective from leaders of the mme project 31 a collaborative initiative to share data to enable rare disease gene discovery and supported by the global alliance the international rare disease research consortium irdirc 32 clingen 33 and the individual mme services we note that the mme and beacon projects represent distinct approaches to data sharing the mme provides access to extremely detailed patient data eg matching caselevel detail and data owner and requires logging into an mme service and depositing caselevel data such as phenotype and genegenotype the structure of the beacon project allows for very easy access to data but the data shared are less detailed currently only the existence of a variant
 
we identified nineteen categories of data use conditions and clarified their descriptions these were then classified into primary categories or secondary categories and as requirements based on their occurrence and on the resulting criteria for data access
 
for validation purposes and to ensure as much compatibility as possible we compared our classification to how the nih ascribed dbgap consent groups based on the nih duls and to the daa categorization performed by the ega on the daas related to the studies with data stored in it we included the abbreviations adopted by the nih for overlapping data use conditions eg gru hmb

our proposed method uses the fixed effect model fem and the random effect model rem iteratively the fem is employed to test m genetic markers one at a time pseudo qtns are included as covariates to control false positives specifically the fem can be written as follows yimi1b1mi2b2mitbtsijdjei3 where yi is the observation on the ith individual mi1 mi2 mit are the genotypes of t pseudo qtns initiated as an empty set b1 b2  bj are the corresponding effects of the pseudo qtns sij is the genotype of the ith individual and jth genetic marker dj is the corresponding effect of the jth genetic marker ei is the residual having a distribution with zero mean and variance of e2
 
the rem is employed to optimize the selection of pseudo qtns from markers based on their testing statistics ie p values and positions by using the super algorithm24 mathematically the rem can be written as follow yiuiei4 where yi and ei stay the same as in eq 3 and ui is total genetic effect of the ith individual the expectations of the individuals total genetic effects are zeros the variance and covariance matrix of the individuals total genetic effects is g2ka2 where a2 is an unknown genetic variance and k is the kinship matrix defined by pseudo qtns
 
the iterative usage of the fem 1 and the rem 2 is specifically described by the following steps
 
step 1 set known candidate qtns as pseudo qtns otherwise leave pseudo qtn set empty
 
step 2 perform association tests by using the fem with pseudo qtns as covariates genetic markers are fitted as fixed effects one at a time
 
step 3 substitution when the testing marker is one of the pseudo qtns the testing marker is not solvable as each pseudo qtn is examined for every marker we use the most significant p value for the corresponding marker we call this process substitution
 
step 4 if no marker passes a threshold eg 1 after multiple test corrections take the result from step three as final otherwise go to step five point
 
step 5 whole genome is divided into bins and the snp with the most significant p value in each bin represents the bin bin size eg 500 5000 and 50000 kilo base pairs and number of bins eg from ten to one hundred with step of 10 are optimized in the rem the combination of size and number with the minimum reml value will be used to select pseudo qtns in each iteration the number of pseudo qtns is bounded by a function of sample size eg nlog10n to reflect the ability to detect qtns in the sample
 
step 6 elimination linear dependence or near linear dependence among pseudo qtns when two pseudo qtns have pearson correlation coefficients above a threshold eg 07 remove the less significant pseudo qtn
 
step 7 if no new pseudo qtns are added or if the specified maximum number of iterations is reached stop otherwise go back to step two point
 
we used previously published datasets from multiple species that included arabidopsis thaliana human maize mouse and pig
 
we used two datasets of arabidopsis thaliana the first dataset includes one hundred and ninetynine samples with 216130 snps and one hundred and seven phenotypes21 when phenotypes had less than one hundred records a minor allele frequency maf of zero point zero five was set to filter the snps the second dataset includes 1179 samples with 214545 snps one sample was removed because onehalf of the genotypic data is missing url  the kinship matrix and principal components were calculated by gapit42 using 10 of snps sampled randomly

the maize genotype dataset includes 2279 inbred lines each with 681258 snps the phenotype is flowering time measured as days to silk29 url  the kinship matrix and principal components were calculated by gapit using 10 of snps sampled randomly
 
the mouse genotype dataset has 1940 samples 1000 males and nine hundred and forty females from a heterogeneous stock mice population owned by the welcome trust centre for human genetics with 12226 snps the phenotype is weight growth intercept30 the kinship matrix and principal components were calculated by gapit using all snps
 
the pig genotype dataset has eight hundred and twenty samples 412 large white and four hundred and eight crosses from large white and landrace with 64212 snps the phenotype is last rib backfat thickness31 all snps were used to build the kinship matrix and principal components
 
we used real genotype datasets from human and arabidopsis thaliana to simulate genetic effects and generate phenotypes by adding residual effects the qtns underlying these phenotypes were randomly sampled from the real genotypes the qtn effects followed a geometric distribution with an additive effect of parameter a the effect of the ith qtn was ai the parameter a was set to 09 095 and one as described in previous studies917 phenotype was simulated as y  additive effect  residual effect additive effect was calculated as additive effect  qtn matrix  qtn effects the residual effect following a gaussian distribution with mean of zero and variance of e2 was calculated as e21h2a2h2 where a2 is the variance of additive effect and h2 is heritability simulations were performed using a variety of qtn numbers and heritability values and with qtns included and excluded from the genotypic data for association tests for each combination of factors simulations were repeated either one hundred or 1000 times specified for each experiment
 
statistical power type i error and fdr were examined simultaneously in association tests on simulated phenotypes with known qtns using the method described by segura etal25 and two methods from our previous studiessuper24 and enriched cmlm22 a qtn was considered identified if a positive marker was within a prescribed interval distance eg fifty kb power was defined as the proportion of qtns identified at a threshold of type i error or fdr markers were used to derive the null distribution of negative control if no qtn was within the interval the null distribution of type i error was derived from the nonqtn markers fdr was defined as the proportion of the nonqtn markers among the positive markers
 
the flowering time candidate genes from the database reported by atwell et al 2010 nature were used to evaluate the associated snps on twentythree flowering time traits in arabidopsis thaliana the whole arabidopsis thaliana genome was divided into gene regions and nongene regions the genes and their extensions 10000 base pairs on either side were considered gene regions with a total length of 4552815 base pairs 39 of whole genome the remaining areas were considered nongene regions with total length of 114616742 base pairs 961 of whole genome the average hit per base pair was defined by number of associated snps divided by total length the ratio of average hit on gene regions to the average hit on nongene regions was used as the enrichment coefficient the random hits were expected to have an enrichment coefficient of one point

the aggregation of the muscleexpressed q35yfp fusion protein was assessed by adding eggs isolated from rmis132unc54pq35yfp and rpn10ok1865 rmis132unc54pq35yfp animals via hypochlorite treatment to nga plates and then incubating the plates at 23c for seventytwo hours 112 after this time essentially all of the animals were gravid adults the number of individual q35yfp aggregates were scored using a fluorescent stereomicroscope as previously described and digital images were captured at 6x magnification using a nikon eclipse inverted compound microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination and a nikon endow gfp filter cube 26 the aggregation of the intestineexpressed q44yfp fusion protein was assessed by adding eggs isolated from dris20vha6pq44yfp  rol6su1006 and rpn10ok1865 dris20vha6pq44yfp  rol6su1006 animals via hypochlorite treatment to nga plates and then incubating the plates at 23c for seventytwo hours 48 at this point 100 worms were transferred to either nga plates containing fifty m fudr or rnai plates containing fifty m fudr and spotted with the indicated rnai clone and the plates were returned to 23c for four days before scoring the dris20 worms contained large numbers of aggregates at this point so the percentage of animals with any aggregates present in the intestine was measured by scoring with a fluorescent microscope for s9 fig we also counted individual aggregates in the dris20 worms and to enhance the aggregate numbers in the rpn10 mutant animals we incubated the plates at 23c for five days instead of four days the aggregate numbers were scored using a fluorescent microscope after briefly incubating the plates on ice to reduce worm activity
 
a previously described protocol for assessing the phenotypic effects of shifts from permissive to nonpermissive temperature on the function of the metastable unc54 protein in the unc54e1157 mutant was adapted for the analysis of larval animals 49 briefly synchronized l1 larval populations of unc54e1157 and rpn10 unc54 animals were spotted on nga plates and grown at 16c permissive temperature for twentyfour hours at this time a total of approximately three hundred worms per genotype were transferred to three separate fresh nga plates and shifted to 25c nonpermissive temperature for twenty hours the plates were then allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for twenty minutes before being scoring for paralysis by prodding with a platinum wormpick worms that failed to respond to touch were scored as paralyzed
 
two transcription factor rnai libraries were independently screened to identify transcription factors that permitted survival of the rpn10ok1865 mutant these libraries were 1 a subset library sold by source bioscience which was created from ahringer rnai library clones and 2 a library created from clones in the ahringer and vidal rnai libraries s6 table for each screen individual wells of 24well plates containing nga with 50gml carbenicillin and 02 lactose were spotted with 20l of overnight culture for a clone in the transcription factor library and allowed to dry at room temperature each well was then seeded with 70100 rpn10ok1865 zcis1aip1gfp l1 larvae which had hatched from eggs that were isolated by hypochlorite treatment and then placed in sbasal to arrest the progeny at the l1 larval stage each plate was then incubated at 20c and visually screened for phenotypic effects after three days clones that caused developmental arrest or sickness were then rescreened and clones that were again found to produce these phenotypes in the second round were used to treat larger populations of zcis1aip1gfp animals both with and without the rpn10ok1865 allele in order to find genes required for the development and survival of mutant but not wildtype animals in this manner clones determined to be hits from the initial screen were sequentially narrowed down to those that consistently impaired normal development only in the rpn10ok1865 background
 
code sets that recognize the indicated genes were synthesized by nanostring technologies seattle wa and used with the nanostring ncounter system to measure the levels of each transcript in one hundred ng aliquots of total rna the resulting ncounter data were analyzed using the nanostring nsolver data analysis software with normalization to the geometric mean of the level of the cdc42 pmp3 and y45f10d4 transcripts in each sample 123 the normalized expression data were then exported to ms excel for further analysis
 
rna for nanostring studies was isolated from wildtype n2 or rpn10ok1865 animals grown from egg hatching on control skn1 or 110 diluted elt2 rnai for fortyeight hours this time point was selected because no visible differences in worm morphology were observed in any of the treatment groups so any changes in gene expression likely occurred before the animals became ill due to rnai treatment after washing the animals from the plates in sbasal the worm pellet was then suspended in qiazol lysis reagent and frozen at 80c total rna was isolated using the qiagen mirneasy kit the yield and quality of each rna sample was evaluated using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and also by running an aliquot on an agilent bioanalyzer for each genotypernai treatment pair six biological replicates were performed
 
three independent populations of n2 control and rpn10ok1865 mutant worms were synchronized via the use of hypochlorite treatment and grown on e coli op501 spotted nga plates at 20c for three days the worms were then washed from the plates and washed twice with milliqpurified water the worm pellet was then suspended in qiazol lysis reagent and frozen at 80c total rna was isolated using the qiagen mirneasy mini kit and the rna yield was measured by spectrophotometry total rna was sent to expression analysis durham nc for analysis including agilent bioanalyzer electrophoresis to ensure rna quality followed by library preparation using the illumina truseq rna sample prep kit the resulting library was subjected to highthroughput fifty nucleotide paired end sequencing using an illumina sequencer at a depth of seventeen million reads per sample
 
the resulting sequence data were analyzed as previously described 119 briefly the sequence reads were clipped using internally developed software by expression analysis and matched to the c elegans genome using rsem 124 the resulting transcript counts were then normalized using the upper quartile normalization approach 125 differentially expressed genes were then identified through the use of serial ttesting coupled with benjaminihochberg correction and genes with an adjusted pvalue score less than zero point zero five were considered to be differentially expressed this led to the identification of one hundred and seventyone genes as being differentially expressed 111 upregulated and sixty downregulated between rpn10ok1865 and wildtype n2 s2 and s3 tables overrepresented gene classes were identified in the upregulated and downregulated genes through the use of david 126
 
lysosomes were stained via two complementary approaches the first approach utilized the lysotracker red stain life technologies l7528 and lysosensor green stain life technologies l7535 which concentrate in the low ph environment of the lysosome while the second utilized the magic red cathepsin b and cathepsin l substrates immunochemistry technologies 938 and 942 89 these cathepsin b and l substrates are cellpermeable cresyl violetconjugated peptides containing either the argarg or phearg sequence cleaved by the respective cathepsin in the lysosome and this cleavage event relieves an intramolecular quenching of the cresyl violet fluorophore and produces red fluorescence
 
lysotracker red and lysosensor green staining were both performed by spotting nga plates with an aliquot of dye from a 1mm working stock diluted in sbasal to produce a final concentration of two m 127 the spotted plates were allowed to dry for one hour at room temperature before l4 larval animals were added the worms were stained overnight at 20c and then transferred to unspotted nga plates for one hour to clear residual dye from the intestinal lumen the animals were then mounted on slides and imaged using a nikon eclipse ti inverted microscope using a y2ec filter cube images were captured at 20x magnification using a coolsnap hq2 photometrics ccd camera and nikon elements software fluorescence intensity was measured using imagej 120 we did not stain the control and elt2 rnai treated animals with lysotracker red because preliminary experiments demonstrated greater penetration of lysotracker into the elt2 rnai treated animals particularly we observed the staining of tissues like the hypodermis that are not seen in animals stained on control rnai or nga which suggested that the absorption or distribution of the dye is not similar between the rnai treatments thus precluding reliable comparisons
 
magic red staining was performed by spotting nga control rnai or elt2 rnai plates with an aliquot of dye from a 260x stock prepared by dissolving the powdered dye in dmso following the manufacturers instructions to give a final 1x concentration to facilitate spreading of the dye on the plate the aliquot was mixed with water to produce a final volume of twenty l prior to pipetting onto the plate to conserve dye we performed these experiments in twelve well plates containing three ml of agar per well the plates were allowed to dry for one hour at room temperature before l4 larval animals were added the animals were incubated at 20c overnight and then cleared of residual dye and imaged as described above

the two hundred and thirty target organisms were selected based on i phylogenetic diversity ii relevance to doe mission areas in bioenergy and the environment iii the presence of interesting and potentially interpretable rm systems dna samples were obtained from commercial sources american type culture collection atcc or dsmz or from contributions to the jgi communitysequencing program  a complete list of bacterial strain information and dna sources is provided in s1 table
 
all sequenced organisms have publicly available reference genome sequences and gene annotation files deposited in ncbi and img 51 accession numbers and summary statistics of reference genomes used in the analyses are provided in s1 table the majority of reference sequences were complete assembled into a single circular molecule with more than 90 genomes containing less than ten scaffolds the inclusion of data from draft genome sequences increases our overall yield of mtase gene annotations but limits the ability to comprehensively annotate the methylome in all cases
 
smrt sequencing was performed using a library construction protocol described previously 52 libraries were sequenced on the pacific biosciences rs instrument using either c2 c3 or c4 chemistries the average smrt sequence coverage per genome was 130x ranging from 31x to over 500x with an average subread length of 18kb sequencing chemistries and sequencing yields for each dna sample are summarized in s1 table
 
dna modification detection and motif analysis were performed using the pacbio smrt analysis platform protocol version  220 method  rs modification and motif analysis1  briefly raw reads were filtered using sfilter to remove short reads and reads derived from sequencing adapters filtered reads were aligned to the reference genome using blasrv1 53 modified sites were then identified through kinetic analysis of the aligned dna sequence data 32 modified sites were then grouped into motifs using motiffinder v12 these motifs represent the recognition sequences of mtase genes active in the genome 54 all kinetic data files have been deposited in geo under accession numbers gse69872 available for review using the following link  the full list of identified modified motifs are in s2 table
 
restrictionmodification rm genes were assigned using the seqware computer resource clark et al 2012 murray et al 2012 it comprises a large suite of program modules with specialized databases containing compilations of protein sequences of bonafide m system components as well as nonrm system components to weed out false positives on a daily basis newly published sequences are collected from genbank and downloaded for analysis by seqware and incorporation into the seqware databases many routines that run in parallel scan the new data queue different inspection steps and depending on the preliminary findings pipe data into further more detailed analysis loops
 
first conserved elements of new rm systems are identified by sequence matches to known rm system genes most often these are mtases characteristic motifs 55 56 of the newly detected items are located and functional domains are mapped from these the type and subtype of the inspected system are inferred as well as the identity of potentially missing componentsmost often restriction enzyme genes genes for these missing components are then picked by a contextual analysis where attribution is guided by marginal similarities in typesubtype characteristic component order while skipping genes that show better matches to nonrm system genes homologs that harbor nonrm functions eg rna mtases generate many false hits in this first round of analysis but are then filtered out by further matching to a library of known false positives occasionally fusions of rm system genes to genes of unrelated enzymes are observed to avoid false hits produced solely by the fused parts the nonrm system domains are masked in the search library
 
newly detected systems are prepared for expert review items are annotated and background supporting materials are prepared these include hit lists summary tables schematics plots and selectable alternatives for the resolution of undecided issues eg handling of frame shifts following the curators decisions results are recorded and the internal databases are rebuilt for the next round of discovery the program suite part of seqware changes frequently as new modules are incorporated to accommodate new kinds of relevant data shotgun methylome and as our understanding of rm systems expands seqware has been a prime supporting engine of restriction enzyme research for the last twenty years and is responsible for the bulk of the expansion of rebase 5 rm system gene annotations are summarized in s2 table
 
mtases without detectable rm genes in the flanking genome sequence were cautiously annotated as candidate orphan mtases since restriction enzymes can be hard to identify we cannot firmly conclude that a cognate restriction enzyme gene does not exist and therefore some of these candidate orphan mtases may in reality be part of rm systems however our observation that many candidate orphan mtases exhibit incomplete modification of their genomes fig 4 is one line of evidence to suggest that the majority of these annotations are correct
 
in general the sequence specificity of each putative mtase gene was predicted based on significant similarity to mtase genes of known specificity whenever such a gene was present and a motif of the same specificity was found then the mtase gene was assumed to be responsible unless more than one candidate mtase gene of the same specificity was present in which case no match was called in the case of type i type iig and type iii genes in many cases only a single candidate gene was present for the particular kind of motif observed thus for type i genes the recognition sequences are characteristically bipartite and usually asymmetric for both type iig and type iii mtases methylation is only present on one strand again if only one gene was present then it could be matched unambiguously to the motif in some cases for type i systems one half of the recognition sequence would match half of a known specificity in another organism often this would then permit matching of the appropriate s subunit to the motif in all cases where there were no clear and unambiguous matches the motif was marked as unmatched see s3 table and s4 table in some cases reasonable guesses could be made and these are indicated in s3 table and s4 table by putting the motifs and the genes likely to match them in parentheses
 
nine enzymes have been characterized as restriction enzymes three typical type iig single polypeptide reasemtase proteins have been cloned and their recognition motif determined from their endonuclease cleavage patterns sdeai and plimi from the mmei family and rpai a representative of the taqii family 33 similarly the endonuclease genes for the mjai mjaii mjaiii mjaiv and mjav systems from methanocaldococcus jannachii dsm two thousand six hundred and sixtyone as well as csp12ai from clostridium sp 12a have been cloned expressed and characterized through their endonuclease activity the modified base and recognition motif for three mtases by cloning the mtase gene into the nonmodifying host er2796 followed by smrt sequencing and analysis using methods described in murray et al two thousand and twelve 8 in this way we also characterized the type iii mtase mnme18i which recognizes acm6acc 27 and m1csp12ai and m2csp12ai from clostridium sp 12a
 
amino acid sequences of all annotated type ii mtases were obtained from img and used as queries in blastp blastall v2226 searches of protein sequence databases of 35184 bacterial and archaeal genomes in img database hits with a similarity score of thirtyfive or more where similarity score  100bitscore of hit to database  bitscore of hit to self were considered potential orthologs of the mtase taxonomy information for all database genomes was also obtained from img and used to determine the fraction of organisms across each taxonomic category with a potential mtase ortholog mtases with orthologs in 50 of species from a taxonomic group were considered conserved
 
amino acid sequences of all annotated type ii mtases were obtained from img and split into two groups according to base methylation type m6a or m4c and m5c for each group all versus all alignments were performed with usearch v801616i86linux32 57 using the searchglobal command with parametersfulldpid zero uc initial clusters of related mtases were identified using usearchclusteragg with parameters id zero point three five linkage minfulldp using custom perl scripts mtases were annotated with taxonomic classification of the host organism presence or absence of cognate rease and motif specificity annotated mtase clusters were then manually inspected to identify individual subclusters of orphan mtases with identical or closely related specificities from taxonomically related organisms the resulting subclusters represent putative orphan mtase families
 
the ipdr interpulse duration ratio is the primary metric in dna modification detection it corresponds to the time delay in incorporation of successive bases in a sample versus an unmodified control unmethylated motifs were identified using inter pulse duration ratio ipdr measurements 32 and read coverage for each methylated motif an undermethylated ipdr threshold was determined by comparison of ipdr scores of bases in methylated motifs with those in unmethylated nonmotif sequences ipdr scores for all motif sites in the genome were ranked and an average motif ipdr calculated across the central 60 values to minimize the effect of unmethylated sites or other outliers the average nonmotif ipdr was similarly calculated from the central 60 of ranked ipdr scores from all bases of the same type in nonmotif sequences in the genome the undermethylated ipdr threshold was then defined as 01average motif ipdr09average nonmotif ipdr ie an approximation of the idpr score if 10 of bases were methylated for comparison a methylated ipdr threshold was defined as 05average motif ipdr05average nonmotif ipdr ie an approximation of the idpr score if at least half of bases were methylated analysis of unmethylated motifs was only performed for palindromic type ii motifs that have two methylated sites one on each strand of the genome motif instances were considered unmethylated if both potential methylated bases had at least twentyfold smrt sequence coverage and an ipdr less than the undermethylated threshold importantly the average smrt sequence coverage at unmethylated sites is no different from that at methylated sites s4 fig they are therefore highconfidence unmethylated sites and not simply borderline cases at the thresholds for inclusion in the analysis
 
gene regulatory regions were defined as 100bp upstream of the cds start to 50bp downstream of the cds start fold enrichment of all motif sequences in gene regulatory regions was determined by comparison with the average fraction of randomized control sequences in regulatory regions 1000 random samplings of an equal number of sites in the genome with the same length and nucleotide composition as the modified motif fold enrichment of unmethylated motifs in gene regulatory regions was determined by comparison with the fraction of methylated motifs in regulatory regions sites with ipdr scores greater than the methylated threshold defined above significance of enrichment was determined using fishers exact test to determine the potential enrichment of unmethylated motifs for specific functional classes of genes we repeated these analyses using individual subsets of regulatory regions grouped according to the cog category annotations 58 of their corresponding genes
 
for each orphan mtase family associated with incomplete methylation of the genome fig 4 we identified conserved unmethylated sites based on conservation of flanking gene sequences table 1 for every unmethylated site we took the amino acid sequences of the two flanking genes and identified best hits in each of the other genomes using blastp pairs of unmethylated sites across the two genomes were considered conserved if their flanking genes were reciprocal best hits in the respective other genome for select conserved sites genomic dna sequences upstream of the putative target gene were subject to multiple alignment using mafft 59 and visualized in jalview 60
 
to identify potential overlap between unmethylated dam gatc motifs and transcription factor binding sites we obtained curated transcription factor binding site tfbs probability matrices from  61 and searched for matches to these matrices using mast 62 we restricted our search to tfbs that were identified in gammaproteobaceria using the taxonomic classifications provided by regtransbase and to gammaproteobacerial genomes from our study that contain at least four unmethylated dam motif sites we identified overlap between predicted tfbss and unmethylated dam motifs using bedtools 63
 
candidate enriched clusters of unmethylated motifs were identified as regions of the genome containing at least three consecutive unmethylated motifs each separated from its nearest neighbor by less than the genomewide average distance between motifs table 2 a cluster of unmethylated sites was considered significant if the probability of observing such a series of consecutive sites by chance was   001 based on 10000 iterations of randomly sampling n  number of unmethylated sites times from an ordered list of length l  total motif sites
 
we searched for unusual clusters of motifs regardless of methylation state in noncoding regions of the genome defined using img gene annotations of coding dna sequences and excluding rna gene annotations for each noncoding region we calculated the local noncoding motif density motifs  bp across the one hundred flanking noncoding regions the expected number of motifs in that region was then estimated as noncoding region lengthlocal motif density fold enrichment was determined as observed number of motifs  expected number of motifs pvalues were determined using the pbinom function in r pval  1pbinom observed number of motifs noncoding region length expected number of motifs and subject to bonferroni correction using the number of noncoding regions in the genome a pvalue threshold of 1e5 was used to identify noncoding regions with motif enrichment we identified patterns of noncoding motif enrichment conserved across organisms based on reciprocal best blast hits of flanking genes as described above
 
for methylated motifs showing conserved patterns of motif enrichment we extended our analyses to other sequenced genomes in the same taxonomic class fig 6 for each genome we calculated motif density in 500bp windows with a 50bp stepsize across a 50kb region of the genome centered on the start or end of the gene closest to the motif cluster blast was used to search each genome for orthologs of the responsible mtase and determine correlation between presence of mtase and noncoding motif clusters

six discovery data sets including 13312 samples were analyzed in the stage one point the participating discovery studies were the age geneenvironment susceptibility reykjavik study ages n  1548 the cilento study cilento n  1115 the framingham heart study fhs n  7048 the ogliastra genetic park ogp n  897 the prospective investigation of the vasculature in uppsala seniors study pivus n  945 and the val borbera study vb n  1759 two additional studies the gioi population gioi n  470 and the sorbs population sorbs n  659 provided data for an insilico replication stage 2 further a denovo replication stage 3 was undertaken in the stanislas family study sfs n  676 and in a sample of hypertensive adults ht n  995 from the biological resources center brc igepcv interaction geneenvironment en physiopathologie cardiovasculaire the participating cohorts are described further in section one in s1 text the local institutional ethics boards for each study approved the study design each subject signed an informed consent before participating to the study further details can be found in s5 table
 
in the discovery and insilico replication cohorts genotyping was performed using various arrays and imputation was carried out using the one thousand genome v3 as reference panel in all studies details of preimputation quality control parameters genotyping platforms and imputation parameters for each study are provided in s1 table in all cohorts blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and serumplasma samples were prepared and stored as described in section two in s1 text serum vegf levels plasma vegf were measured in sfs and ht were measured using commercial elisa assays as detailed in section two in s1 text the denovo genotyping at sfs and ht was undertaken on a competitive allele specific pcr kasp chemistry array and variants were called using a fretbased genotyping system
 
in each individual study a natural logtransformation of vegf levels was applied to do that in a few studies ages ogp vb and sorbs where some individuals had vegf levels below the detection threshold of the assay half the minimum value of vegf found in that cohort was arbitrarily assigned to each such participant 96 the transformed trait adjusted for age sex and additional studyspecific covariates eg principal components associated with vegf levels study center for multisite studies was related to the variant dosages using a linear regression studies with familial correlation used linear mixed effect models to account for familial relatedness detailed information about the software used in each cohort is reported in the s1 table an additive genetic model with one degree of freedom was applied study specific results of genomewide pervariant associations underwent additional quality control prior to metaanalysis checking of file formatting data plausibility and distributions of test statistics and quality measurements was facilitated by the gwasqc function of the gwatoolbox package v100 in r 97 prior to the metaanalysis variants with low minor allele frequency 1 and poor imputation quality r2 04 were removed
 
metaanalysis was performed in metal using an effective sample size weighted zscore method 98 this method was chosen over an inversevariance metaanalysis because of different covariateadjusted mean values and standard deviations in vegf levels among studies the results of metaanalysis were adjusted for genomic control inflation factor to define the effective sample size the product of the sample size and the imputation quality for each variant was calculated in each cohort 99 the sum of the product of each cohort divided by overall sample size represents the proportion of the effective sample size for each variant eq 1 i1cniri213312effective sample size1 where c is the total number of participating cohorts i indicates the specific cohort n is the sample size used for the variant association test and r2 is imputation quality of the variant after completing initial quality control checks 6705861 variants each of which was informative at an effective sample size of 70 were included in the metaanalysis stage 1 the genomic control inflation factor of the metal analysis was 1003 all variants having a pvalue less than 5x108 were considered to be genomewide significant
 
to identify all independent associations within the loci reaching genomewide significance conditional analyses were performed in a forward stepwise fashion examining the most significant association and including in successive association models the next most significantly associated variant p5x108 in a specific region at each step referred to as the top variant in eq 2 we repeated this process until no more genomewide significant associations were found the conditional analysis model follows the formula 2 lnvegf01varianti1nicovariatesij1kjtop variantj2 where n is the number of covariates used in the primary gwas k is the number of steps the conditional analysis was only performed in fhs because it represents the largest cohort in the metaanalysis the final conditional analysis model included ten independent variants with pvalues less than 5x108 in fhs
 
genomewide significant variants identified in the conditional analysis were examined in the two insilico replication cohorts and also carried forward to denovo replication furthermore for each suggestive locus 5x108p1x105 the lead variant was also examined in the insilico replication sample and those suggestive variants that reached a genomewide significant pvalue in a metaanalysis of the discovery and insilico replication data stage 2 were also carried forward to the denovo replication phase to check for the presence of other independent variants in the suggestive regions a clumping procedure implemented in plink 100 was performed the 1000genome v3 genotypes were used as reference panel for ld calculation the physical threshold for clumping was one mb and the r2 threshold for clumping was 01
 
for selected variants that failed denovo genotyping a proxy variant having either the highest linkage disequilibrium ld value or the variant in the same region with the next lowest pvalue was genotyped instead of the lead variant we considered as replicated all variants that reached a genomewide significance level in the metaanalysis of the discovery and the insilico and denovo replication samples stage 3
 
for the replicated variants an inverse varianceweighted metaanalysis was also performed as a secondary analysis including in the analysis all the discovery and replication cohorts
 
the variants identified after replication stages were used to estimate in each cohort a genetic score associated with circulating vegf levels by summing the product of the betaestimate and genotype for each variant in a given individual eq 3 riskscorei110igenotypei3 where i is the variant  is effect size of the variant in the cohort and genotype is additively coded genotype of the variant the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the variants incorporated in the score was estimated fitting two linear mixed effect models in which vegf levels were regressed respectively on 1 gender and age basic model 2 gender age and genetic risk score risk score model the variance explained by the replicated variants was estimated as the difference between the variance explained by the risk score model and that explained by the basic model the lmekin function r package which uses the genomic kinship matrix to correct for relatedness between individuals if any was applied
 
the replicated snps and variants in ld with them r208 were investigated for the presence of chromatin histone marks and hypersensitive dnase elements using data from encode included in haploregv3 software  45
 
a database of expression single nucleotide polymorphism esnp was created collecting results from multiple published sources reported in section three in s1 text the esnp results from each study were included in the database if they met criteria for statistical thresholds for association with gene transcript levels as described in the original references to search for eqtls among the associations found in the metaanalysis we queried this database for the replicated variants and their proxies r208
 
two different approaches were used to identify biological pathways influencing vegf variability
 
the gsealike statistical test implemented in magenta program was used to test the overrepresentation of genes containing vegfassociated variants in a given biological pathway to do that all data of metaanalysis results from stage one were used and the geneset annotations from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg panther ingenuity gene ontology reactome and biocarta databases were applied each gene in the genome was scored by the most significant association pvalue among all the snps located within a region from one hundred and ten kb upstream to forty kb downstream of each genes transcript boundaries confounding effects on gene association scores were identified and corrected for this normalized best gene score was used to evaluate the gene enrichment against a null distribution of 10000 gene sets of identical set size that are randomly sampled from the genome the 95th percentile of all gene scores for the metaanalysis was used as the enrichment cutoff genes within the hlaregion were excluded from analysis due to difficulties in accounting for gene density and ld patterns and only gene sets with at least ten genes were included in the analysis significance was determined when an individual pathway reached a false discovery rate fdr005
 
the ingenuity pathway analysis software ipa was used to explore the functional relationship between genes of interest selected from candidate regions for this purpose a candidate region was defined as comprising all variants between the first and last variants in a chromosomal region that were associated at genomewide significance with circulating vegf levels either in discovery phase stage 1 or the combined discovery and replication metaanalysis stage 3 the genes of interest were chosen including all within 60kb of each of the candidate regions a total of twentysix genes listed in the s4 table fit this description and served as input genes for the pathway analysis direct and indirect interactions a reasonable confidence experimentally observed highly predicted or moderately predicted and a maximum size of seventy genesproteins per network were used as parameters in the analysis

to calculate the cumulative cell numbers cells were split at a constant ratio splitting ratio for each passage at each splitting the cell number was counted and multiplied by the splitting ratio the final number is the cumulative cell number the final curve was generated by graphing the cumulative cell numbers over several passages note that for each cell line a novirus transduction control was included to determine the 0day of counting which is the first day when the novirus control was completely dead after drug selection
 
chipseq was performed in the next generation sequencing facility at the national cancer institute nci as previously described 1822 peaks were identified by the macs algorithm 40 for calculating peak intensity the number of tags at each nucleotide within a peak was calculated and summed up for all the nucleotides across the peak the sum was defined as peak intensity which was used to calculate the correlation between cbfb and runx2 binding
 
to assign the peak to specific genes we used the approach we developed previously 22 briefly we arbitrarily defined the promoter region as the region between five kb upstream to five kb downstream of the transcription start site tss of a transcript the rest of the region within the gene body 5 kb downstream of tss to the end of transcription is defined as the gene body region we also define regions twentyfive kb away from the transcript as distal

we chose lineages to sequence with the goal of elucidating the timing demographic context and geographic origins of dogs we selected the basenji and dingo for sequencing as they represent two divergent breeds basal on the dog phylogeny 35 we also utilized the boxer reference genome as an additional haploid chromosome set the chinese croatian and israeli wolves represent lineages sampled geographically from the three regions from which dogs were previously hypothesized to have originated east asia europe and middle east respectively the golden jackal was chosen as an outgroup this sampling strategy is also informative for understanding selection early in the dog lineage as it captures the range of variation found in both dogs and wolves thus minimizing the confusion of selection signals from later lineagespecific effects such as might occur were we to bias sampling towards modern breeds of european origin all genotypes initially generated in canfam three point zero reference genome coordinates by freedman et al 19 were converted to the most current version canfam 31
 
demographic factors such as population expansions bottlenecks or population structure are confounders that distorts expected signatures of recent positive selection 9111287 since most domesticated species experience a population bottleneck 88 and a frequent mode of selection during domestication is selection from standing variation 4089 detection of positive selection during domestication is difficult to detect selective sweeps on the dog lineage during domestication we selected three statistics that have been shown to have the highest power to detect selection under these conditions 89 fst 40  40 and td 4090 we used a sliding window approach in which we divided the reference genome into overlapping windows of size 100kb with 10kb increments for each 100kbwindow we computed summary statistics using only sites that passed the genome and samplelevel filters 19 we considered the boxer reference haplotype when we compute statistics within the dog sample or between the dog and wolf sample because our analysis included a mixture of haploid boxer reference and diploid samples we calculated fst from estimates of nucleotide diversity ie between  within between where nucleotide diversities are average per site estimates calculated across all pass filter sites within a 100kb window we computed  as wolfdog in each window and report values on a logscale ie log and td is computed as the difference in tajimas d between the wolf and dog sequences in cases where dog was zero we added a small fractional increment so that  would still be computable in cases where no segregating sites within dogs exist in a window we did not calculate td
 
we obtained 195998 sliding windows of size 100kb with 10kb increments genomewide we then discarded any windows in which the number of fully observed sites is less than 30kb because it is more likely that those windows are within or close to repeatcnv regions or regions of poor sequencing quality
 
in order to minimize the confounding of neutral demographic signals with those produced by positive selection we developed an approach to control for the false positive rate with simulations using the posterior mean parameter estimates from the bestfitting model fig 5a in 19 we first simulated 200000 one hundred kb windows using the program ms 91 under the demographic model that we previously inferred from the same seven genomes including boxer analyzed here 19 and computed  fst and td for those windows next for each window in our observed data we computed the proportion of simulated windows with a test statistic  that in an observed window ie a pvalue defined as the probability of the observed data under neutrality we then computed fdr using the benjaminihochberg procedure for our set of windows based upon our empirical data for each test statistic we retained windows with fdr001 we considered the effects of simulation strategy on fdr calculations and outlier window identification by drawing one thousand samples from the joint posterior distribution of our bestfitting demographic model and simulating each of these samples two hundred times for a total of 200000 100kb windows as the sliding window approach means that windows are often clustered across the genome fig 1 we collapsed windows across statistics into outlier regions if they were within 200kb of each other as a heuristic to rank outlier regions we took a composite of multiple signals cms approach similar to that employed in a recent selection scan in humans 43 specifically we computed cms1fdr as 1fdr1fdrfst1fdrtd and ranked regions according to the maximum cms1fdr observed in any of the 100kb windows comprising a region we note that given  tajimas d cannot be calculated for windows with no polymorphism we have excluded windows with strong signals in fst and  that are potentially of interest orange points on far right of fig 4a
 
to contrast our demographyinformed approach of controlling for fdr with neutral simulations we examined overlap of outliers based upon this approach with a fundamentally different demographyfree approach that examines an arbitrary percentage of a top set of outliers similar to many genomewide selection scans that dont explicitly include demography in this approach for each summary statistic fst  and td we computed empirical percentiles by ranking each window by the summary statistic in question and transforming the ranks to percentiles  fst   and  td we then calculated a joint empirical percentile by computing the product of the empirical percentiles obtained for the three summary statistics in each window  product   fst      td and then ranking each window by the products  product and transforming the ranks to percentiles  joint in order to draw manhattan plots we transformed the joint empirical percentiles defined for each window into joint empirical pvalues joint empirical pvalues are defined as a probability of obtaining a joint empirical percentile greater than or equal to that observed for the window in question for the joint empirical percentile we defined the top 1 windows as outlier windows as with our primary approach described above windows  200kb apart were collapsed into outlier regions for this method we ranked outlier regions by the maximum joint percentile
 
for our analysis of the distribution of sites fixed between dogs and wolves we first identified sites where the basenji and dingo were homozygous for the boxer reference derived allele and where the three wolves and golden jackal were fixed for an alternative ie the ancestral allele we then reduced this set of candidate sites by only including sites where the dog derived allele was observed across the 12breed genome sequences at a frequency  075 we evaluated the functional consequences of dogspecific nonsynonymous variants using ensembls variant effect predictor 
 
to detect functional enrichment within the genes intersecting our outlier regions we used the program david 74 with the canis lupus gene set as background we focused on the genes falling within 25kb of the peak cms1fdr signal for the top one hundred regions minus those regions that did not also show a reduction in diversity in the 12breed data set because enrichment analyses require a relatively large input set of genes in order to detect enrichment patterns and given that we already perform statistical inference to identify regions under selection we report all categories with fdr  10 we also report uncorrected pvalues as well as pvalues corrected for multiple comparisons using benjaminis method although the latter are generally considered to be extremely conservative 74

patients with ibd and healthy controls were genotyped using the illumina human omniexpress12v10 beadchip at the wellcome trust sanger institute according to the manufacturers protocol after genotype calling with illumina gencall software snp data was processed in the following sequence using plink 35 samples with a sex mismatch abnormal heterozygosity proportion of missing snps 5 and duplicated or related samples identified using identity by state were removed snps with missing calls 5 extreme deviation from hardyweinberg equilibrium pvalue 1108 or which were monomorphic were removed finally principal components analysis of the postqc genotype calls combined with calls from hapmap3 founder individuals downloaded from  using the rbioconductor snpstats package confirmed all samples were of european ancestry s18 fig genotype data was read into r version three point zero two  using the snpstats package and stored as a snpmatrix object snps with minor allele frequency maf 5 were excluded from eqtl analysis leaving 626858 autosomal snps these data have been deposited in the european genomephenome archive ega and are available on request egas00001001251
 
genotype data for aav patients were available from a previous gwas 36 briefly genotyping was performed by aros applied biotechnology aarhus denmark using the affymetrix snp six point zero platform snp genotypes were called using the crlmm algorithm 37 and standard qc performed as described previously 36
 
two hundred ng rna was processed for hybridization onto affymetrix human gene st one point one microarrays according to the manufacturers instructions prior to scanning microarrays were processed with the automated genetitan instrument which uses a 96well plate chip probe intensity files cel were read into r version three point zero two using the bioconductor oligo package 38 raw intensity values were preprocessed with the robust multiarray average rma algorithm which performs background correction quantile normalization log2 transformation and summarization to gene level via a median polish probe annotation was obtained from the pdhugene11stv1 bioconductor package the resulting expression matrix and phenotype data was stored as an expressionset object the raw intensities for the expression data for each cell type were read in and normalised separately the arrayqualitymetrics package was run on the normalised expression matrices before and after batch correction with combat see below and poor quality samples removed microarray data are available in the arrayexpress database wwwebiacukarrayexpress under accession number emtab3554
 
principal components analysis of the expression matrices indicated batch effects to address this we used two alternative approaches the first approach was removal of unwanted expression heterogeneity by adjustment for latent factors using probabilistic estimation of expression residuals peer 39 the use of peer has increased eqtl discovery compared to standard methods in a number of studies 4 40 peer can model both known confounders and hidden latent factors in the expression data we ran peer specifying batch and sex as known confounders and used the expression residuals as the dependent variable in the subsequent eqtl scan for the analysis of celltype specificity comparison of direction of effect between cell types and for the intersection of eqtls with gwas snps we used eqtls detected from association scans using peer residuals
 
alternatively we performed batch correction using the combat function from the sva surrogate variable analysis bioconductor package 41 combat was implemented specifying diagnosis as a covariate of biological interest whose effect should be preserved this method was used for the genotype  disease interaction analysis and the pre and posttreatment analysis
 
the ggtools bioconductor package 42 was used to combine snpmatrix and expressionset objects for patients for whom we had both good quality genotype and expression data to create an smlset object table one shows the numbers of samples available for analysis by disease and cell type for the bayesian joint analysis across cell types presented in fig 1 we used all available samples even if this meant differing sample sizes for each cell type for the estimates of eqtl celltype specificity from oneatatime celltype analysis we confined eqtl mapping to individuals with expression data available for all cell types to ensure equal power for each cell type in the latter scenario subsetting was performed after preprocessing and adjustment for latent factors or batch correction in order to make direct comparisons with results from separate celltype analysis we also used the bayesian method on the subset of individuals with expression data available for all cell types s19 fig for the detection of eqtls to intersect with gwas snps we used all available samples to maximise power even if this meant differing sample sizes for each cell type the expression versus genotype boxplots in figs 2 3 6 seven and eight show all individuals for whom we have good quality expression and genotype data rather than restricting to the subset of individuals with expression data available for all cell types
 
filtering of probesets in the expression data was performed prior to the eqtl scan filtering of expression data has been shown to increase power to detect differentially expressed genes and should not bias fdr estimates as long as the variable of interest is not used in the filtering step 43 probesets on sex chromosomes and those which did not map to an entrez gene id were removed the remaining probesets were then filtered by variance bioconductor genefilter package as well as increasing power filtering by variance has two additional benefits first genes which are expressed homogeneously are not informative in an eqtl analysis second unexpressed genes will show little variability between samples and thus filtering on the basis of lack of expression variability is a reliable method for detecting and excluding unexpressed genes from further analysis 44 in the downstream analysis we compared eqtls detected in each cell type in order make these comparisons valid it was necessary to perform eqtl mapping on the same filtered list of probesets in each cell type to achieve this we retained any gene whose variance across samples was in the upper quartile in any one of the cell types for the joint ibdhv analysis this resulted in 9041 probesets when using all available samples and 9242 when restricting to the sixtyfive individuals with expression data available for all cell types for the aav analysis the same filtering procedure resulted in 8916 probesets when using all available samples and 8979 when restricting analysis to the thirtythree patients with complete expression data available for cd4 t cells cd8 t cells monocytes and neutrophils
 
this analysis was performed using the ibdhv dataset restricted to the individuals with expression data available for all five cell types n  65 to identify probesets targeting robustly expressed genes in each cell type the following procedure was performed first we calculated the mean expression of each probeset across all samples from a given cell type using expression data that had been rmanormalised and then batchcorrected with combat to determine thresholds for declaring probesets as expressed or nonexpressed in that cell type we used the normalmixem function from r package mixtools to fit a mixture of two gaussian distributions to the vector of mean probeset expression values starting values for the expectationmaximization em algorithm were chosen assuming 50 of expressed probesets and the initial mean values of the underlying gaussian distributions were set equal to the first and third quartile of the probeset expression distribution the distribution with the lowest mean expression was considered as that corresponding to nonexpressed genes a detection threshold was set by taking the 95th percentile of this distribution probesets whose mean expression was above the detection threshold were considered to be expressed in that cell type subsequently probesets that did not map to an entrez gene id were removed the lists of probesets expressed in each cell type were then intersected to find those expressed in all cell types probesets on the sex chromosomes and those which did not map uniquely to an entrez id were removed this resulted in 5186 probesets the matrix of peeradjusted expression data was then subsetted to retain only these probesets and the eqtl scan was performed using the residuals from peer as the dependent variable
 
we performed cis eqtl mapping with the allcis function in the ggtools bioconductor package previous work has suggested that the most cis eqtls are approximately centred around the transcribed region with few eqtls lying more than 50kb from the gene 6 7 45 for each gene we defined cis snps as those lying in the region spanning 100kb up and downstream from the gene start and end positions respectively snp location information was obtained using the bioconductor package snplocshsapiensdbsnp20120608 dbsnp build 137 sensitivity analysis using varying distances to define cis found no increase in eqtl discovery for cis distances greater than one hundred kb using a 5 fdr significance threshold
 
the allcis function calculates association statistics score tests for each cis snptranscript pair specifically the function fits a generalized linear model with transcript abundance as the continuous dependent variable and genotype as the predictor variable optionally potential confounders of an expressiongenotype association can be included as covariates genotype is a discrete variable coded 0 1 or two according to allelic dose ie homozygous snp genotypes are coded zero or two and heterozygous genotypes are coded 1 for each gene each snp in the cis region was tested in turn for association with mrna abundance after adjustment with peer using an additive genetic model after the base model was fitted ie a model with an intercept and any specified covariates a score test was then performed for addition of genotype to the model the tests used are asymptotic chisquared tests based on the vector of first and second derivatives of the loglikelihood with respect to the parameters of the additive model where the dataset comprised more than one disease grouping ie ibd and healthy individuals the diagnostic grouping was included as an additional covariate we did not include sex as a covariate as sex had already been specified as a known confounder when running peer
 
ggtools provides estimates of the fdr through estimation of the distribution of statistics under the null by breaking expressiongenotype relationships through permutation of sample labels the plugin fdr method 46 see s1 text a 5 fdr was used to declare statistical significance
 
to evaluate eqtl celltype specificity we used the eqtlbma package which implements the method described by flutre et al 16 we ran this according to the instructions in the user manual briefly we first transformed the expression level of each gene into the quantiles of a standard normal distribution ties were broken randomly we then ran the eqtlbmabf programme to compute the bayes factors assessing the support in the data for each probesetsnp pair being an eqtl we analysed the ibd patient and hv data together specifying disease status as a covariate to maximise power we used all available samples from ninetyone ibd patients and fortythree hvs even if this meant that for some individuals we did not have full expression data for all cell types in this scenario we used the option error hybrid samples from aav patients were analysed separately to avoid difficulties that might arise from combining genotype data from a separate platform again we used all available samples the output file containing the bayes factors was then fed into the eqtlhm programme to fit the hierarchical model with an em algorithm and get to maximumlikelihood estimates of hyperparameters and the configuration probabilities to obtain the posterior probabilities we need an estimate of the probability for a gene to have no eqtl in any tissue 0 to do this we implemented the ebf procedure using the genelevel bayes factors averaged over the grid and configuration weights estimated via the em algorithm finally we ran eqtlbmaavgbfs to obtain i the posterior probability pp for the gene to have an eqtl in at least one cell type ii the pp for a snp to be the eqtl assuming one eqtl per gene iii the pp for the snp to be an eqtl iv the pp for the eqtl to be active in a given tissue and v the pp for the eqtl to be active in a given configuration we used a pp corresponding to a 5 bayes fdr as the significance threshold
 
to evaluate estimates of eqtl celltype specificity from oneatatime celltype analysis we limited the ibdhv analysis to sixtyfive individuals 47 ibd patients eighteen hvs in whom samples passing expression quality control were available for all five cell types by using the same set of individuals the sample size and genotype matrix predictor variables were identical for each cell type in order to make a fair comparison between the results from the oneatatime celltype analysis and those from eqtlbma we reran eqtlbma on these same sixtyfive individuals with full expression data for all five cell types in this latter scenario we used the option error mvlr s19 fig and s1 text
 
for all possible pairings of the cell types we took those esnpgene associations that were statistically significant in both members of the pair in the oneatatime celltype analyses fdr 005 and compared the direction of effect on expression in each we did this by plotting the estimated coefficient beta for the genotype term in the first cell type against that in the second the betas were estimated from regressing peeradjusted expression on genotype using the lm function in r for the ibdhv analysis disease status was included as a covariate eqtls with opposing directions of effect between cell types have a positive beta in one cell type but a negative beta in the other see s1 text for more detailed discussion
 
to identify eqtls influenced by the presence or absence of inflammatory disease we analysed the joint ibdhv dataset using a linear model with a genotype  disease interaction term expression data for each cell type was rma normalised separately but within each cell type expression data from healthy individuals and ibd patients were normalised together we used expression data that had been batchcorrected with combat as adjustment for latent factors with peer might remove genuine disease effects we again restricted testing for each gene to cis snps for each genesnp pair a linear model was fitted using expression as the dependent variable and genotype coded 01 or 2 disease status coded zero and one for healthy and ibd respectively and a genotype  disease interaction term as the predictor variables this was performed in r using the lm function
 
fitting a model with an interaction term is statistically more robust than the naive approach of separate analysis of ibd and hv cohorts followed by comparison of the resulting lists to find eqtls common to both groups and those identified only in ibd or only in hvs the latter approach would result in an excess of false declarations of groupspecific eqtls in particular the comparison of lists approach is unduly influenced by the difference in statistical power to detect eqtls in each group when the group sample sizes are different the ibd group was larger than the hv group and so there was greater power to detect eqtls in the former this would have led to many false declarations of ibdspecific eqtls had we used the comparison of lists approach see s1 text for more detailed discussion
 
the analysis was performed for cd4 t cells cd8 t cells monocytes and neutrophils b cells were not analysed due to the low number of samples available from healthy individuals for each cell type we used all available ibd and hv samples see table one for sample sizes we limited testing of snps to those with maf of 10 or higher as power decreases with decreasing maf probesets were filtered in the following order first removal of probesets that were nonlowly expressed in that cell type and those which did not map to an entrez gene id second filtering of the remaining probesets by variance to retain only those in the upper 40
 
interaction effects are harder to detect than main effects so to improve our power we employed a twostep procedure adapted from methods used to detect genotypeenvironment interactions in gwas 47 twostep procedures aim to reduce the multiplicity burden associated with having a large number of variables to explore by applying some filter step 1 on the number of variables actually tested step 2 in order to prevent biasing of fwerfdr estimates the filtering procedure used in step one should be independent of the final test statistics in step two point in step one we performed linear regression of expression on genotype main effect of genotype with no covariates importantly by not including disease status as a covariate we ensured independence of the step two statistics 47 snpgene pairs passing the step one threshold 1 were eligible for step two testing we used a pvalue of 5105 for 1 a more liberal 1 allows more snpgene pairs through to step 2 but at the price of more multiple testing and a more stringent threshold in step two point in addition because there were multiple correlated snps due to ld where multiple snps were significantly associated with the same gene at the threshold 1 only the most significant snp per gene was taken forward to step two point
 
in step 2 we fitted the full model with regression of expression on genotype disease and a genotype  disease interaction term pvalues for the interaction terms were then adjusted for the number of tests performed in step two with the padjust function in r using the benjaminihochberg procedure and a zero point one five fdr threshold used to declare significance qvalues were also calculated
 
each cell type was analysed separately we used eqtlbma to jointly analyse expression data from the three timepoints baseline three months and twelve months we used we used the option error hybrid as the individuals in each subgroup were overlapping but not identical for genes with a significant eqtl 5 bayes fdr we took the snp with the highest posterior probability for being the eqtl for this list of snpgene associations we then assessed the posterior probabilities for each of the twentythree  one  seven possible configurations
 
to identify the effects of diseaseassociated snps on gene expression and how this varies between cell types we examined the overlap of snps associated with complex traits from the nih national human genome research institute gwas catalogue  download date twenty may 2015 with eqtl snps esnps discovered in each cell type in our analysis the snps identified in eqtl studies or gwas are not necessarily themselves causal variants but instead may be in ld with them therefore gwas tag snps and proxy snps in high ld with them r2 08 were crossreferenced with cis eqtls found in each cell type snap was used to identify proxy snps  using the one thousand genomes  pilot one data ceu individuals as the reference population
 
to define the esnps for crossreferencing we repeated the analysis using two levels of stringency for declaring colocalisation of eqtl and gwas signals for the basic criteria a gwas signal was declared to colocalise with the eqtl if the gwas snp or one of its proxies was a significant eqtl fdr 005 for the more stringent criteria in addition to the basic criteria the gwas snp or one of its proxies had to be the most significant cis esnp for that gene s1 text s16 fig
 
for the detailed examination of the effects of ibdassociated snps on gene expression we took snps identified in the ibd gwas metaanalysis 16 as hits in either crohns disease cd ulcerative colitis uc or both ibd supplementary table two of that paper and crossreferenced these snps and proxies r2 08 with the eqtl snps from our analysis as above see s1 text
 
colocalisation testing was performed using the coloc package 21 we used the publically available summary statistics for ibd cd and uc gwas metaanalysis by jostins et al 17 along with our eqtl data

farmed asian seabass lates calcarifer were obtained from the marine aquaculture centre singapore all experiments were approved by agrifood and veterinary authority ava institutional animal care and use committee iacuc approval id avamac201202 and performed according to guidelines set by the national advisory committee on laboratory animal research naclar for the care and use of animals for scientific research in singapore
 
backcrossed and inbred fish were genotyped to identify the fish which exhibited the least heterozygosity individuals displaying a range of 550 homozygosity could be identified based on the markers used for genotyping 10 a backcrossed individual bc8 with decreased genomic polymorphism dgp 40 based on the markers analyzed was chosen and sacrificed to collect blood as well as the majority of organs to serve as a resource for the asian seabass genome project
 
we estimated the genome characteristics using a kmer analysis of the raw illumina sequencing data and estimated the genome wide rate of heterozygosity by evaluating the shape of the kmer frequency distribution
 
we counted the frequency of all kmers k  21 in the data using jellyfish 74 the observed kmer distribution was bimodal with distinct peaks at 36x and twice this amount at 72x coverage s1 fig which is characteristic for a heterozygous genome 75 we analyzed the distribution by fitting a mixture model of two negative binomial distributions centered at mu and mu2 representing the heterozygous and homozygous kmers respectively eq 1 the negative binomial components generalize the poisson distribution with an additional size parameter for the variance the kmer model also includes two scaling parameters s1 and s2 that depend on the genome size and the overall rate of heterozygosity
 
eq one point kmer coverage model for heterozygous diploid genomes
 
we determined the parameters of the model using a nonlinear leastsquares estimate with the nls function in r the resulting values fit the data well with the two peaks centered at 366x and 732x coverage and small residual error s1 fig this also naturally excludes the low coverage kmers caused from sequencing error that should not be included in the genome size or heterozygosity estimates the modeling allows us to estimate the number of nonrepetitive heterozygous and homozygous kmers as 96126339 and 491559122 respectively by summing the densities for the two components of the model separately using these values we further estimate the overall rate of heterozygosity to be 0405 eq 2
 
eq two point formula to determine rate of heterozygosity
 
the number of heterozygous kmers in half for both the numerator and denominator is divided in half to evaluate the haploid content the number of heterozygous kmers is divided by k to account for that heterozygous base will contribute k heterozygous kmers k  21 this will slightly undercount heterozygous bases that are within k bases of each other allowing for a range in the overall heterozygosity rate
 
for generating genome sequence data genomic dna was isolated from the chosen individual using qiagen genomictip100 qiagen hilden de as per standard protocol genomic dna from the blood was used for the construction of two separate bac libraries in pcc1bac vector amplicon express pullman wa usa altogether representing 12x genome coverage libraries comprised an eco ri 36864 clones library with an average insert size of 120 kb and a bam hi bac library 36864 clones with an average insert size of 115 kb
 
sequence data for the genome project was obtained from multiple platforms which are summarized below
 
sequence data from the pacbio platform was generated in two phases

asian seabass liver genomic dna from the chosen individual was used for the construction of two 500 bp and 750 bp linear insert truseq illumina libraries as per standard protocol and sequenced using hiseq 1500 with one lane for each insert sized library 2x100 a total of two hundred and eighty million pairs of reads were generated 56 gb data representing 80x coverage of the asian seabass genome
 
the first seven point five plates each containing 384wells from each library bam h1 and eco r1 were sequenced from both ends using m13 forward and reverse primers the overall data quality of sequences was good with a pass rate of 95 and an average of seven hundred and sixtynine high quality phred20 bases per read the total number of trimmed sequences from eco r1 and bam h1 library forward  reverse was 5703 and 5646 respectively making a total of 11349 sequences
 
the primary genome assembly with 90x pacbio data was performed using hgap algorithm followed by polishing using quiver 15 as part of the pacific biosciences smrtanalysis pipeline to facilitate genome assembly a make script available at  was used the statistics of the 90x pacbio assembly are detailed in s1 table
 
quake 76 and decontamination was performed on the illumina hiseq reads and assembled along with bac end sequences using soapdenovo127mer 77 kmer was set from 2181 the statistics are summarized in s1 table
 
for the assembly done at cshl instead of using the full celera assembly pipeline 78 the algorithms were used separately bogart 79 was used for unitigging to help resolve some of the repeat issues pacbios hbardtk 15 was used to finalize the assembly the hbardtk software retained the singletons unlike the celera assembler 78 which discards singletons and only keeps consensus contigs there were totally 3604 singletons in this assembly and after their removal the number of contigs reduced to 4223 the assembly statistics are summarized in s1 table
 
the assembled seabass transcriptome 16 was used for scaffolding the 90x pacbio genome assembly using the lrnascaffolder tool 17 s1 table resulting in the scaffolded genome assembly v2
 
the assembled genome was evaluated using different metrics described below
 
the assembled genome was evaluated for completeness using the two hundred and fortyeight core eukaryotic genes dataset cegs1819 and for quality using quast 80
 
the 11191 bac end sequences were used for aligning against the genome assembly blastn 81 minimum alignment length cutoff of 100bp and a threshold evalue of 1e6 a base level comparison was also done wherein 7783146 bp bases representing 11159 bes were compared using blastn 81 to the genome assembly
 
for both the five hundred and seven hundred and fifty bp illumina libraries totaling to 80x genome coverage 99 of the hiseq pairedend reads mapped correctly to the genome assembly with 97 of the reads in pairs with similarity cut off of 90 and aligned read length 90 s3 fig
 
a total of seven hundred and seventytwo unique marker sequences from the asian seabass linkage map 21 were blastsearched 81 against our genome scaffold sequences retaining the top five blast hits for further analyses for each marker on the linkage group we selected the best alignment based on marker sequence alignment coverage if a marker sequence had more than one alignment to different regions of the genome but with the same alignment coverage both alignments were retained further to that only alignments that had percentage identity 90 and marker alignment coverage 80 were kept finally if a given genome scaffold had markers from multiple linkage groups aligned to it a manual inspection was performed to select for the linkage group that was represented predominantly this analysis resulted in six hundred and eighty 88 of the marker sequences having an alignment to the genome scaffolds as shown in s11 fig
 
optical map data generation and the whole genome de novo assembly process have been described in detail earlier 8284 briefly high molecular weight hmw dna was obtained from frozen blood of the same asian seabass individual from which genome sequence information was obtained using opgens blood processing protocol opgen gaithersburg md usa the resulting dna was evaluated on opgens argus whole genome mapping system and quality metrics were reviewed the average molecule size obtained from this dna prep was approximately three hundred and four kb xbai was selected as a suitable enzyme for generation of the optical map data a total of eleven highdensity mapcards were selected from those generated by argus on an average 68000 single molecular restriction maps smrm were marked up on each card typically only molecules longer than two hundred and fifty kb total 377118 smrms were used in the analysis these smrms were assembled into genomewide maptigs by using opgens gentig software 8586 by aligning smrms based on restriction map pattern using a greedy algorithm with limited backtracking for finding an almost optimal scoring set of maptigs gentig also takes into consideration the possible errors of smrms such as standard deviation digestion rate false cut and missing cut during the assembly process totally one hundred and four maptigs representing the whole genome of asian seabass were generated these assembled maptigs were then aligned with scaffolds of the assembled genome sequences 40 kb to aid in the orientation and joining of these sequence scaffolds resulting in the assignment of five hundred and seventyseven contig sequences with a combined length of four hundred and eightysix point three eight mb s9s14 tables
 
the optical map data also identified fiftyfive sequences that potentially contain misassemblies as different parts of these sequences showed alignment onto different maptigs s15 table
 
we first performed whole genome alignment of the primary asian seabass genome assembly hgap contigs with the chromosomal scale genome assemblies of european seabass 22 and threespined stickleback 23 using the last alignment tool 87 the output maf files were filtered for 11 ortholog alignments using singlecov2 88 subsequently we combined pairwise alignments into multiple alignments using the multiz tool 89 we then used ragout 90 to infer the order of asian sea bass contigs according to colinearity with g aculeatus and d labrax assuming a closer relationship of d labrax and l calcarifer the ordered contigs were written into scaffold sequences and in a second iteration aligned with the d labrax genome alone which enabled us to find further contig links after each iteration the resulting order of contigs was manually checked to remove suspicious interchromosomal connections subsequently we compared the results with data from optical mapping and removed contig links that were clearly not in agreement with the contig order from optical mapping resulting scaffolds that were supported by shared synteny and optical mapping were relatively large contained most of the assembled l calcarifer sequence and could be ordered into chromosomal sized sequences using information from the l calcarifer genetic linkage map 21
 
we performed blastn 81 alignment min alignment identity 95 between neighbouring contigs ab placed in the assembled chromosomes and found a large number of contig end a to contig start b overlaps only  strand overlaps were used gaps between overlapping contigs were then closed by trimming the overlap region from the contig a and concatenating contig b to it this process was performed by custom scripts written in linux awk language s16 and s17 tables
 
as described above whole genome alignments of the final chromosome scale assembly v3 of l calcarifer with d labrax and gaculeatus genomes were performed by last 87 and filtered by singlecov2 maf output files were subsequently converted to the satsuma format by custom scripts awk and processed by the blockdisplaysatsuma script from the satsuma v117 package 91 to result in coordinates of syntenic blocks between the different genomes this process was done in two iterations the removal of spurious very short blocks 6000 bp after iteration one resulted in larger collinear blocks after iteration two point syntenic blocks along the twentyfour l calcarifer chromosomes were plotted using circos 92 additionally we plotted links between collinear blocks to underline if they were rearranged in d labrax or g aculeatus
 
the assembled asian seabass genome was masked based on known repeats using repeat masker 93 and the repbase vertebrate libraries 24 s2 table de novo repeat masking was performed on the genome with windowmasker 94 and repeatscout 95
 
a collection of tandem repeats were obtained using tandem repeat finder trf version four point zero seven 96 and postprocessed 97 the parameters used for the trf search were maximum mismatch 5 maximum period size 2000 and default values for other parameters s3 table
 
miniature invertedrepeat transposable elements ltr elements and potential transposon orfs were also determined from the whole genome assembly using mite hunter 98 ltrharvester 99 and transposonpsi  respectively the predicted genes from the asian seabass genome were later searched against transposable elements obtained from the ltrharvest mites and transposonpsi databases evalue of 1e06 and 80 percentage alignment length to remove predicted genes that aligned with transposable elements transfer rnas trnas were also searched by trnascanse 100
 
the consensus sequences for repetitive families generated by repeatscout 8248 repeat families see s6 table for details were classified using teclass 101 into four categories according to their mechanism of transposition namely dna transposons ltrs lines and sines consensus motifs that showed sequence similarity to refseq 102 genes were filtered out as they are likely to belong to a gene family or be part of a conserved domain to assign a repeat classification to the consensus motifs of repetitive regions they were searched against the transposable elements determined from the genome assembly by mite hunter ltrharvester and transposonpsi as well as the repeats present in repbase 24
 
we used the jellyfish software 74 for computing 23mer frequencies and choosing a subset of 23mers with coverage greater than 1000 we used the cookiecutter package 103 for extraction of raw reads containing subset of 23mers with coverage greater than one thousand point the selected reads were used to manually assemble tandem repeat monomer consensus sequences with the help of the targeted de novo shortread assembler price 104
 
assembled tandem repeats were compared with known repbase repeats 24 and all related to transposable elements were excluded following which tandem repeats assembled from raw reads were aligned against the pacbio error corrected reads using blast 81 to improve the consensus sequences by including more individual monomers the consensus sequences were used to find and estimate the repeat copy number and arrangement in the genome assembly the interruption of tandem repeats monomers arrays in smrt reads could be verified by hiseq reads containing transition fragments
 
the genome was screened using repeatmasker version 405 93 against the entire vertebrate repeat library and subsequently against the published l calcarifer specific repeats 12 interspersed repeats were hardmasked with ns and simple repeats were softmasked a final round of masking was performed using dustmasker rmblast version 2228 105
 
first putative gene loci were identified the other vertebrates protein collection from genbank 106 was retrieved and filtered to retain only proteins from ray finned fish species the resulting 388340 proteins as well as the 1184879 reconstructed transcripts and ests were mapped to the genome using a tblastnblastn run through genblasta 107 which provided coordinates for putative gene loci
 
proteintranscript alignments were then refined and augustus hints were generated the genomic region of the putative gene loci 25 kb flanking regions were excised and the corresponding proteintranscript sequences linked to these gene loci by genblasta were aligned using exonerate 108 customized scripts were used to convert the exonerate output to gff3 format with genomic coordinates and generate an augustus hints file
 
a l calcariferspecific training annotation file was generated through the augustus training web interface 109 using 22322 l calcarifer ests augustus was run separately for each genomic contig using default parameters extrinsicexntcfg the contigspecific hints file and the l calcariferspecific training annotation file augustus utr prediction was disabled and only a single transcript was predicted for each putative gene locus
 
in addition gene predictions were also performed using maker2 110 with assembled illuminabased transcriptome pacbio isoseq transcriptome and high quality proteins from percomorphaceae taxon maker2 predicted 29401 genes and 100765 different proteins for mapping pacbio isoseq to assemebled genome we used gmap software 111
 
the proteins predicted by augustus and maker2 were clustered with the proteome of the threespined stickleback using orthomcl 112 the resulting clusters were further analysed to verify that augustus and maker2 predictions originated from the same genomic locus based on these analyses we classified the genes into four groups 1 conserved predictions augustus and maker2 proteins are orthologous have a stickleback ortholog and originate from the same gene locus 2 species specific predictions augustus and maker2 proteins are orthologous and originate from the same gene locus 3 unplaced conserved predictions augustus and maker2 proteins are orthologous have a stickleback ortholog but originate from different gene loci and 4 uncertain predictions the remaining predicted genes
 
for the conserved and speciesspecific categories the gene prediction from augustus or maker2 that was the longer at the defined locus was chosen as the representative since manual verification had shown that maker2 predictions were often truncated compared to augustus for unplaced conserved predictions the gene at the locus identified by augustus was chosen as the representative uncertain predictions were not included in the final consensus gene dataset transcripts in the consensus dataset were then given unique identifiers the final dataset was filtered for potential duplicates
 
the asian seabass reference proteins were aligned to proteins annotated in swissprot and trembl databases 113114 using blastp from ncbi blast package 115 with evalue set to 10e5 and the best hit was chosen for each protein
 
runiprscan110 client  was used for searching known protein motifs and domains by searching against publicly available databases available in interpro 25 including pfam prints prosite prodom and smart the gene ontology go terms were retrieved from runiprscan110 results for each protein the mapping to kegg pathways 27 was computed using kaas webserver 116 the statistics for functional annotation are summarized in s26 table

fastq files were converted to fasta format and hd adaptor sequences were trimmed by removing the first four bases of each read followed by the 3 adaptor and preceding four bases sequences shorter than 18nt and comprised of two or fewer unique bases were removed from further analysis
 
mirnas were annotated by searching all animal precursor hairpins from mirbase 120 against the reference genome e  10e6 generating a set of putative premirna sequences overlapping blast hits were merged and mature mirnas annotated in mirbase 120 were searched against putative precursors using patman 121 those hairpins with a match to a mature mirna with up to one mismatch were then folded using rnafold 122 and those forming a valid premirna hairpin structure were annotated as mirnas in order to further annotate mirbase 120 orthologues we mapped our small rna reads to the putative hairpins those with evidence of expression in our samples that were consistent with precise dicer and drosha processing were annotated as highconfidence mirnas those with no evidence of expression or small rna expression that was not consistent with precise mirna biogenesis were classified as lowconfidence
 
new mirnas were predicted using both mircat 123 and mirdeep2 124 using default parameters predictions were merged to obtain a nonredundant set of candidates and known mirna families from mirbase 120 identified previously were removed from the predicted novel mirna set small rna reads were aligned to predicted mirnas and the read alignment pattern and secondary structure were checked manually to ensure that they are consistent with canonical mirna biogenesis any predictions that did not meet these criteria were removed
 
bestfit models for each multiple protein sequence alignment were predicted using prottest three point four 125 phylogeny trees were generated from the multiple sequence alignments using phyml three point zero 126 with default parameters and the model selected by prottest generating trees for 12741 protein clusters

we collated the available clinical and molecular data from large 400 cases systematically ascertained cnv studies of sz from the literature or known to us via our collaborations we similarly collected data on other neurodevelopmental disorders such as ddasd and multiple congenital anomalies mca focusing on two large studies based on referrals to genetic clinics and on three studies that specifically determined the parental origin of these duplications and reported on the presence of triplicationsidic15 table 1 we used the reported information on parental origin of the 15q112q133 duplications or where possible obtained dna samples to establish this details in s1 text most teams that we approached responded to our requests but some had no access to patient dna and could not take part
 
the control cohorts included 149780 individuals table 1 the largest sample was from iceland 115000 genotyped individuals at the time writing a populationbased cohort containing related individuals and those affected with medical andor neuropsychiatric conditions an ideal control cohort would only have one individual per family to avoid biases from oversampling within population lineages however the icelandic sample is designed to achieve total population coverage therefore it is impractical to single out unrelated individuals the rate of 15q112q133 duplications in this population was assumed to be unbiased without excluding relatives of individuals with or without 15q112q133 duplications in fact this population approaches the ideal general population ascertainment that should give the best estimates for the various analyses performed here therefore we decided to retain the two pairs of relatives who were carriers in this population
 
penetrance was estimated according to the formula originally proposed by vassos et al 37 updated for the joint effect of ddasdmca and for sz as we proposed earlier 26 briefly we first estimated the rate of the duplications in the general population we assumed that the control healthy population comprises 95 of the population as explained in our previous work 11 the rest of the population is made up of approximately 1 sz and 4 ddasdmca cases from this we estimated the proportion of 15q112q133 duplication carriers in the general population that develop sz or ddasdmca the penetrance although many duplication carriers might have both sz and ddasdmca we made the simplifying assumption that they would usually be ascertained only once as the ddasdmca patients referred for genetic testing and the sz patients recruited for studies might represent a more severely affected subgroup we repeated the estimates after reducing by half these population rates down to 05 for sz and 2 for ddasdmca and show these results in the s1 text s3 table estimating 95 confidence intervals for the frequencies in each population followed the method we used in our previous paper 26 briefly we first estimated the binomial cis for the frequencies of cnvs in each population including controls and the general population using the wilson score interval upper and lower 95 bounds for penetrance were estimated from the upper or lower bounds of cnv frequencies in patients and the lower or upper bounds of the frequencies in the general population
 
according to the mutationselection balance theory pathogenic mutations in the general population are found at low frequencies where the addition of de novo mutations is balanced by the selection pressure against them q  s where q is the allele frequency in the general population  is the mutation frequency and s is the selection coefficient 1126 in order to estimate the selection coefficients s of 15q112q133 duplications of maternal and paternal origin we used the methods outlined in our previous work 1126 as follows the selection coefficient of a cnv can be approximated as the proportion of de novo cnvs out of the total number of cnvs de novo and inherited that are observed in an unbiased sample of cnv carriers this is because the number of cnvs filtered out by natural selection is approximately equal to those introduced in the population as de novo mutations after making the simplifying assumption that the frequency of the cnv does not change from generation to generation we then estimated the mutation rate of the duplications using the above formula we should point out that the actual differences between maternal and paternal mutation rates are prone to error eg due to the flipping of maternal and paternal duplications according to the gender of transmitting parents and possible differences in fecundity between affected male and female carriers discussion
 
we established the parental origin of 15q112q133 duplications for carriers from studies where it was previously unknown or not reported table one and s1 table these were the studiesdatasets by gawlick alexic the bbgre database 18  and new carriers in the icelandic population and three published datasets 121623 parental origin was established by one of several methods for dna available to the cardiff laboratory we used a methylationsensitive highresolution melt curve analysis as described previously 81938 s1 text and s1 fig the same method was used for the samples from canada 7 in the icelandic sample parental origin was either determined with methylationsensitive southern analysis 5 or by longrange haplotype analysis s1 text microsatellite analysis was used for the bbgre dataset 18

we first consider a single biallelic snv let g be the genotype coded as the number of minor alleles at the variant site and let d be the disease status we denote the genotype distribution under hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe by pg where  is the minor allele frequency maf note that the hwe assumption has a minimal effect for rare variants as homozygotes of minor alleles are not expected instead of observing g we observe the total number of reads mapped to the snv and the number of reads carrying the minor allele denoted by t and r respectively similar to samtools gatk and seqem 15 we assume that r given t and g follows a binomial distribution prtgbinomialtifg0binomialt05ifg1binomialt1ifg21 where  is the probability that a read allele is different from the true allele and is referred to as the error rate the errors here comprise both basecalling and alignment errors we treat  as a free parameter that is locusspecific and will be estimated from the read data 15
 
to account for casecontrol sampling we adopt the retrospective likelihood with individual contribution prritidig012prritigdiprgtidig012prritigprgdi where the second equation follows from two assumptions first the binomial distribution for read count data depends only on the underlying genotype not on the disease status second the genotype distribution depends only on the disease status not on the read depth thus the likelihood based on n subjects takes the form lcc1010id1g012p1ritigp1gid0g012p0ritigp0g2 where d1 and d0 denote the sets of cases and controls respectively d denotes the allele frequency for d  d and 1 1 and 0 0 are separate parameters for cases and controls note that in writing eq 2 we assume that the depth t is independent of the genotype g also note that this formulation obviates the need to model other covariates eg age and environmental exposures as long as they are not confounders the null hypothesis of the association test is h0 1  0 we reparameterize 1 0 in terms of   such that 0  e1  e and 1  e1  e then the null hypothesis is h0   zero point the score function for  under h0 as derived in s1 text can be written as si1ndin1ng i3 where g ig012gp diritigp 0gg012p diritigp 0g n1 is the number of cases and  0 1 0 are restricted maximum likelihood estimates mles under the null these restricted mles can be obtained via the expectationmaximization em algorithm described in s2 text g i can be interpreted as the posterior dosage of the minor allele estimated under the null hypothesis as the read depth increases g i converges to the underlying genotype gi and s reduces to the standard score statistic i1ndin1ngi finally we construct the burden statistic w as a weighted sum of the score statistics at a set of snvs in the gene of interest the variance estimator v for w is calculated as the empirical variance of the efficient score functions 16 when true snvs are used the test statistic zwv is asymptotically normal with mean zero and variance one point
 
the score statistic of the derkach test 14 has the same form as eq 3 as it also uses the posterior dosage g i the only difference is that the derkach test substitutes the genotype likelihood p diritig that is provided in the output of standard genotype calling packages 8 9 which calculate error rates based on phred scores
 
in reality the locations of rare snvs are not available without calling genotypes in order to include the maximum set of variants in the burden test without calling genotypes we develop a screening algorithm to screen every locus ie base pair in the genome and filter out only loci that are uninformative in the sense that they yield s  zero and thus do not contribute to the test statistic specifically we consider the likelihood lsi1ng012 pritigpg which is based on a homogenous group ie cases or controls only of n subjects let   be the mle based on ls under the constraint that   0 1 and note that  0 indicates no mutation in this group at this locus fortunately we can easily determine whether  0 without iteratively solving for   by definition   also maximizes the profile likelihood pl  max log ls  because we have shown in s3 text that pl is a concave function of  a negative derivative of pl at   zero leads to  0 at   0 the  maximizing log ls  can be easily determined because in the absence of any minor alleles all reads carrying the minor allele must be errors therefore we check the sign of the derivative of pl at   zero for cases and controls separately and screen out the loci at which both signs are negative if  0 in both cases and controls then  00 in the combined sample where  0 was defined in the text following expression eq 3 from  00 we have g i0 for all individuals and thus s  zero point this screening algorithm only involves evaluating simple derivative functions twice at each locus without any iteration and is thus computationally extremely efficient
 
although most monomorphic loci are uninformative and will be screened out there are exceptions it is possible that a truly monomorphic locus has  0 in one disease group or both if by chance some individuals have more errors than expected if a truly monomorphic locus has  0 in the control group but  0 in the case group the score statistic s of this locus will have a negative mean such loci will accumulate over the gene when controls have systematically lower depth or higher error rate than cases and then the expected value of the burden statistic w will be substantially biased below zero even when allele frequencies are identical among cases and controls at true snvs consequently screening for snvs in the presence of differential sequencing qualities between cases and controls will invalidate the asymptotic version of our test
 
we thus propose a bootstrap procedure for assessing the significance of the observed test statistic z the idea is to generate bootstrap datasets that mimic the original data in terms of read depth and error rate have the same number of truly monomorphic loci and true snvs but have no difference in allele frequencies among cases and controls to this end we condition on the observed depth t and simulate the minorallele read count r using the estimated error rates  1 and  0 once the underlying genotype g is simulated however it is nontrivial to simulate g because we do not know how many loci in the gene are true snvs and what are allele frequencies at these snvs to obtain this information we first form a monomorphic dataset by simulating r at every locus in the gene assuming that all gs are zero thus each read for the minor allele is an error that occurs with rate  1 or  0 depending on the disease status this dataset should provide a good approximation to the truly monomorphic loci in the original data as the proportion of true snvs in the original data should be small let ms be the number of loci that are screened in from the original data and let fs be the cumulative distribution function cdf of estimated mafs at the ms loci let mm and fm be their counterparts in the monomorphic dataset the cdf of allele frequencies at true snvs denoted by fp is related to fs and fm through the equation fsfm1fp where  is the proportion of monomorphic loci among loci that are screened in this equation expresses the fact that the distribution of observed nonzero allele frequencies fs in the original data is a mixture of the distributions for allele frequencies of true snvs fp and artifactual snvs fm that actually correspond to monomorphic loci we estimate  by mmms and fp by fp11fsfm where fs and fm are empirical cdf estimators of fs and fm respectively to ensure that fp is monotonically increasing we refine fp by fitting an isotonic regression to data points of 11fsfm evaluated at the pooled ms  mm mafs by the pooledadjacentviolator algorithm pava 17 after the largest value of maf we set fp1 finally starting from the monomorphic dataset we select mpmsmm loci to be snvs sample  from fp and regenerate g and r at these snvs to form a final bootstrap dataset note that for a small  we may need to resample g repeatedly until each truly polymorphic locus screens in the bootstrap statistic is then calculated based on all the loci that were screened in from the final bootstrap dataset the entire procedure is repeated to generate multiple bootstrap replicates
 
although bootstrap tests are computationally intensive in general we can save considerable time by adopting a sequential stopping rule 18 we stop after generating lmin bootstrap replicates if these early replicates suggest a large pvalue when lmin  5 the number of replicates at termination has a median of only ten for a gene having no snvs that affect the trait we also use a closed sampling scheme in which we restrict the total number of bootstrap replicates to be at most kmax if we stop when lmin bootstrap statistics exceed the observed z and kobs kmax replicates have been collected we set the pvalue to lminkobs if we stop when kmax replicates are reached and only lobs lmin values exceed z we set the pvalue to lobs  1kmax  1
 
the mles of error rates may not recover the true distribution of error rates which is essential for generating valid bootstrap replicates in particular when the true error rates are very small eg  002 the mles tend to be overdispersed therefore we propose the following adjusted empirical bayes eb estimator of the error rate to be used in bootstrap instead of the mle which is calculated separately among cases and controls we assume a prior beta distribution for error rates ie j  betaa b where j  1  m m is the total number of loci in the gene and a and b are hyperparameters that can be consistently estimated by the method of moments see s4 text while the eb estimator is easily obtained s4 text it is known that the distribution of eb estimators is overshrunk 19 louis and shen 19 proposed estimators that have good distribution rank and expected value but these are cumbersome to compute we use a simplified version of the louis and shen estimator in which we first calculate the eb estimators but then replace the ordered eb estimators by ordered quantiles of the prior beta distribution evaluated using the methodofmoments estimators of a and b because the sample size m is typically on the order of a few hundred a and b are accurately estimated ensuring that the distribution of the adjusted eb estimates will closely resemble the prior true distribution of error rates
 
we have observed that a small proportion of read data r t do not fit the binomial model 1 this may be due to genotype mosaicism ie the presence of two or more populations of cells with different genotypes in one individual experimental artifacts sample contamination or copy number variants to detect data that do not fit the binomial model for each individual at each locus that screens in we calculated a likelihoodratiotype statistic for the goodness of fit to the binomial model q2logrtr1rttrmaxg012egr1egtr where eg   05 and one   for g  0 1 and 2 respectively then we mask an individual at a variant by setting t and r to zero if q is greater than ten and remove a variant altogether if more than five individuals are masked at that locus we can also identify individuals with problematic data by checking for the presence of an excessive number of qs greater than ten point

here we describe the proposed method sartp for assessing the association between a dichotomous outcome and a predefined pathway consisting of j genes the same procedure can be applied to study a quantitative outcome with minor modifications
 
we assume we have data from l gwa studies with each consisting of nl subjects l  1l each gene in that pathway can contain one or multiple snps while any two genes may have some overlapped snps for simplicity we use superscript l to represent an individual study for subject i in study l i  1nl let yil be the dichotomous outcome eg disease condition casecontrol status taking values from 01 and let xil be the vector of covariates to be adjusted for the centralized genotypes of q snps within a pathway are presented as a vector gilgi1lgiqlt for subject i we assume the following logistic regression model as the risk model logit pyil1xilgilxiltlgilt i1n
 
under the selfcontained null hypothesis h0   0 we denote the maximum likelihood estimate of l as l let yil11expxill and uilyil1yil the raos score statistic vector on  which is the sum of score vectors from l participating studies follows the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution n0v where sstq1l1li1nlgilyilyil1 and vl1li1nluilgilgilti1nluilgilxilti1nluilxilxilt1i1nluilxilgilt2
 
for study l let ntl be the number of subjects having their genotypes measured as htl or imputed at snp t where htlg1tlgntltlt as pointed out by hu berndt 24 if the covariates and genotypes are uncorrelated or weakly correlated the covariance between scores at snps t and s can be approximated as vtsl1lntslu lcovhtlhsll1lntsltsu lvarhtlu lvarhsl ts1q3 where ntsl is the number of samples that have their genotypes available at both snps in study l u lnl1i1nluil and covhtlhslnl1i1nlgitlgisl here we assume that the pearsons correlation coefficient ts between two snps is the same among all participating studies this assumption is valid as long as subjects from all studies are sampled from the same source population or the population under study is relatively homogeneous such as a study of subjects with european ancestry in the united states
 
when only the summary statistics ie the estimated marginal log odds ratios tl and their standard errors tl are available for each of the l studies the score statistic at snp t defined by eq 1 can be approximated as stl1ltl2 tl t1q4
 
note that ntlu lvarhtltl2 thus according to eq 3 we have vtsl1lntslntlnsltstlsl5
 
assume that ts can be estimated from a public dataset eg one thousand genomes project and the sample sizes ntl and ntsl are known we can approximately recover the variancecovariance matrix v  vtsqq of score statistics s  stq1 in cases when we only have the snp pvalue p and its marginal log odds ratio  we can compute its standard error as 1p2 where 1p2 is the quantile satisfying p121p2p with 12 representing a 1df chisquared random variable
 
with recovered score statistics vector s and its variancecovariance matrix v we can conduct a pathway association test using the framework of the artp method the artp method first combines pvalues of individual snps within a gene to form a genebased association statistic ie the genelevel pvalue and then combines the genelevel pvalues into a final testing statistic for the pathwayoutcome association in the original artp method 9 proposed the use of a resamplingbased method to evaluate the significance level of the pathway association test here we integrate the snplevel score statistics into the artp framework and use dsa 28 to evaluate the significance level which is much faster than the original artp algorithm 31 below is a brief summary of the improved artp algorithm
 
first we obtain the pvalues pt10ptqj0 of qj distinct snps in gene j as pt0p12st2vtt let pj10pjqj0 be their order statistics such that pj10pjqj0 for any predefined integer k and snplevel cut points c1    ck we define the observed negative log product statistics for that gene at cut point ck as wjk0t1minqj cklogpjt0 k1k
 
we sample m copies of vectors of the score statistic from the null distribution n0v and convert each of them to be the tail probability of 12 as pt1mptqjm m  1m which are then used to calculate wjkm m  1m the significance of wjk0 can be estimated as jk0wjkmwjk0m1mm1
 
the artp statistic for testing association between gene j and the outcome is defined as tj0mink1kjk0 note that for any wjkm the set wjkmm0m and mm forms its empirical null distribution the significance of wjkm therefore can be estimated as jkmwjkmwjkm mm and m1mm1 m1m
 
this idea which was given by 32 can be used to avoid the computationally challenging nested twolayer resampling procedure for evaluating pvalues the pvalue of tj0 can be readily calculated as zj0tjmtj0m1mm1 j1j where tjmmink1kjkm zj0 is the estimated genelevel pvalue for the association between the outcome and the jth gene to obtain the pathway pvalue a similar procedure as above can be applied to combine already established genelevel pvalues zj0 j  1j through a set of k genelevel cut points d1   dk for simplicity let k0 be the significance pvalue of negative log product statistics defined on zj0 j  1j at a specific cut point dk k  1k the artp statistic for the pathway association is defined as t0mink1kk0 the top dk genes at which k0mink1kk0 can be regarded as the set of selected candidate genes that collectively convey the strongest pathway association signal
 
in the following discussion we will use the term sartp to represent the proposed pathway analysis procedure using the snplevel summary statistics as input and reserve the term artp to represent the original artp procedure that requires the individuallevel genetic data both procedures adopt the dsa algorithm to accelerate evaluating the significance level when performing the pathway analysis in this paper we set snplevel cut points as c1c2  12 ie genelevel association is summarized by one or two most significant snps within each gene and genelevel cut points as dkkmax1j20 k  110 where j is the number of genes in a pathway and j20 is the largest integer that is less or equal to j  twenty point we used m  one hundred and five dsa steps to assess the significance level of each pathway in the initial screening for pathways with estimated pvalues 104 we further refined their pvalue estimates with m  one hundred and seven or one hundred and eight dsa steps
 
many gwas consortia usually publish their metaanalysis results by providing only the combined results from the fixed effects model rather than the summary statistics from each participating study we can apply sartp to this metaanalysis result directly with some modifications first since the reported marginal log odds ratios for each snp by using the fixed effects inversevariance weighting method is given by tl1ltl2 tll1ltl2 with its standard error given by tl1ltl2126
 
based on eq 4 we can see stt2t by assuming large sample sizes and certain conditions see s1 text we can also approximate the covariance between st and ss which is given by eq 5 as vtsntsntnststs7 where ntl1lntl and ntsl1lntsl thus using just the metaanalysis result without knowing summary statistics from each participating study we can still obtain st exactly and approximately recover vts as a result we can carry out the pathwaybased metaanalysis based on the snplevel metaanalysis result as if it were summary data from a single study we call this approach the metaanalysis based sartp msartp
 
however to apply the msartp we need additional sample size information nt and nst in order to properly estimate the variancecovariance matrix defined by eq 7 if the same set of snps are studied by all participating studies we have nt  ns  nst and the approximation eq 7 becomes vtststs ie we can obtain the estimated variancecovariance matrix without knowing nt and nst but in most applications not all gwas choose the same snp genotyping array even after the imputation using the same reference genomes as a result the snp coverage ie the set of snps evaluated in each participating study can be quite different in those situations we need to know the snp coverage information in each participating study in order to obtain ns and nst we will show in the results section that using msartp with an inappropriate uniform coverage assumption ie nts  nt  ns which is commonly made by many multilocus approaches can lead to inflated type i error
 
given snplevel summary statistics from each participating study we can either apply sartp directly or first conduct a snplevel metaanalysis and then apply msartp to the metaanalysis result these two approaches use the same score statistics and different but consistent estimates for the variancecovariance matrix numeric experiments in the results section suggest that these two approaches generate vary similar pathway pvalues
 
we downloaded definitions for 4716 human and murine mammalian pathways gene sets from the msigdb v50 c2 curated gene sets genomic definitions for genes were downloaded from homo sapiens genes ncbi36 and reference genome grch37p13 using the ensemble biomart tool
 
the diagram diabetes genetics replication and metaanalysis consortium conducted a largescale gwas metaanalysis to characterize the genetic architecture of t2d 13 we downloaded the summary statistics generated by the diagramv3 stage 1 gwas metaanalysis from wwwdiagramconsortiumorg 13 the metaanalysis studied twelve gwas with european ancestry consisting of 12171 cases and 56862 controls up to two point five million autosomal snps with minor allele frequencies mafs larger than 1 were imputed using ceu samples from phase ii of the international hapmap project studyspecific covariates were adjusted in testing t2dsnp association under an additive logistic regression model 13 snplevel summary statistics from each gwas were first adjusted for residual population structure using the genomic control gc method 33 and then combined in the fixed effects metaanalysis
 
we sorted two point five million autosomal snps by their corresponding metaanalysis sample sizes in s1 fig which shows that there are two major groups of snps with equal sample sizes one group of 469985 snps 190 had 12171 cases and 56862 controls which included all the available samples in the metaanalysis another group of 1431361 snps 579 had 9580 cases and 53810 controls since the calculation of covariance vts in eq 7 relies on nts the number of samples having genotypes available at both snp s and snp t in order to obtain an accurate estimate of nts we focused on these two groups of snps which in combination had a total of 1901346 snps for any two snps in this reduced set it is certain nts  minnt ns the pearsons correlation coefficients ts were estimated using an external reference panel consisting of genotypes on five hundred and three european subjects ceu tsi fin gbr and ibs from the one thousand genomes project phase 3 v5 20130502

tsss were called within each window in which the strandspecific 5 end read count at any given nucleotide position met or exceeded a threshold of five reads this threshold was determined in a previously described method 33 in short the fdr was estimated based upon the distribution of startseq reads across the genome and a background model where the probability of finding a given number of aligned reads by chance is given by a sum of poisson probabilities the read threshold was selected to allow less than one expected false positive by this measure
 
in those windows where a single nucleotide position met or exceeded the read threshold a gene tss was called the calling method aims to select as the tss the position with the highest read counts in window region with the highest read density to accomplish this two potential tsss were first determined the first was the position with the most aligned 5 ends across the entire window for the second the search window was divided into 200nt bins at every ten nt across the search window at the 200nt bin with the most overlapped 5 ends the second potential tss was called as the position with the most aligned 5 ends of the two putative sites the tss closest to the associated annotated refseq tss was selected
 
following gene tss identification uatsss and datsss were found for uatsss and datsss search spaces were defined in antisense orientation as one to one thousand nt upstream and one to two thousand nt downstream respectively uatsss and datsss were called at the position with the most aligned 5 ends within the search window if the count at any single nucleotide position met or exceeded a threshold of five reads to ensure that identified datsss were not simply miscalled gene tsss or uatsss additional criteria were used to filter datss calls a datss call was filtered if 1 within one thousand nt upstream of the datss there was a genomic position with startseq reads greater than or equal to 10 of reads at the associated gene tss on the same strand as the gene tss implicating the datss as a potential uatss for an uncalled gene tss or 2 it was within one thousand nt of an annotated tss on the same strand implicating the datss as a potential gene tss
 
prior to alignment pol ii chipseq reads from mcf7 cells 23 see also supplemental table 1 were filtered based on quality reads with an average sanger quality score less than twenty were removed from analysis following quality filtering cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences 30 alignment was performed using bowtie 31 fragment lengths were estimated using homer version 46 34 from each uniquely mapped fragment the fragment was extended based on the estimated length and the fragment center was subsequently found

to identify occurrences of pol iiassociated and known vertebrate motifs fimo version 4100 was used considering a p  zero point zero zero zero one significance cutoff and a 0order hidden markov model from promoter regions as background 36 publically available position weight matrices from jaspar were used in motif identification 18 the jaspar polii database 2008 version thirteen motifs and vertebrate motifs in the jaspar core database 2014 version two hundred and five motifs were used for pol iiassociated and known vertebrate motif identification respectively across all promoter regions on the order of one hundred and five pol iiassociated and one hundred and seven known vertebrate motifs were identified motifs and additional information are available at 
 
de novo motif discovery was performed using meme version 4100 with default parameters 37 sequence windows from 35 to 20 and from 5 to 5 relative to tss positions were used sequences from each tss class were combined prior to motif analysis logo plots were generated using web logo three after aligning identified motifs 35
 
cpg island heatmaps reflect the intersection of annotated cpg islands retrieved from ucsc genome browser 17 with tsscentered windows
 
sequence conservation heatmaps were generated using phylop scores from placental mammal alignments retrieved from ucsc genome browser 19 each position in the heatmap represents the average score over all positions in a 40bp bin for which phylop scores were available
 
grocap data from k562 and gm12878 cells 7 were compared to datsss identified in t47da12 cells if a given site did not have grocap signal in either k562 or gm12878 cells that datss was considered t47da12 specific the list of genes with t47da12specific datsss was applied to ingenuity pathway analysis 38 considering experimentally observed associations over mammalian tissues and cell lines
 
nuclei were harvested from cultured t47da12 cells and digested for five minutes at 37c with a range of mnase worthington concentrations reactions were stopped by the addition of edta and then treated with rnase and proteinase k digested dna was isolated by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation libraries were prepared using an illumina truseq sample preparation kit and sequenced on an illumina hiseq for pairedend fifty base reads
 
publically available mnaseseq data 22 and data generated in this work were prepared in the same way prior to alignment mnaseseq reads were filtered based on quality reads with an average sanger quality score less than twenty were removed from analysis following quality filtering cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences 30 alignment of mnaseseq read pairs was performed using bowtie 31 from each uniquely mapped fragment the fragment center was found any report of mnaseseq coverage only considers the fragmentcenter position
 
faireseq data were collected as described previously 24 publically available faireseq data 24 and data generated in this work were prepared in the same way prior to alignment faireseq reads were filtered based on quality reads with an average sanger quality score less than twenty were removed from analysis following quality filtering cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences 30 alignment of faireseq reads was performed using bowtie 31 aligned faireseq reads were then deduplicated using picard version 1118 39 faireseq fragment lengths were estimated using homer 34 for each uniquely mapped fragment the fragment was extended based on the estimated length and the estimated fragment center subsequently found reported faireseq coverage only considers the fragmentcenter position
 
over biological triplicates total rna was harvested using an rneasy kit qiagen with oncolumn dnase treatment rna quality was validated by bioanalyzer agilent pairedend strandspecific polya enriched libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq two thousand five hundred for one hundred and twentyfive base pairedend reads
 
prior to alignment rnaseq reads were filtered based on quality reads with an average sanger quality score less than twenty were removed from analysis following quality filtering cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences 30 insert lengths were estimated by transcriptome alignment using bowtie 31 sequence alignment was then performed using tophat version 204 40 following deduplication by picard 39 alignments from individual replicates were merged fpkm values were calculated using cufflinks version 221 41
 
for publically available data sets with the exceptions of mcf7 pol ii chipseq data and of faireseq and mnaseseq validation data sets read coverage files were retrieved from public depositories s1 table given that reported read densities were considered the data processing of the original authors was effectively observed deeptools was used to generate matrices describing the intersection of read coverage with tsscentered genomic windows observing strand specificity when appropriate 42 these matrices were then used to generate heatmaps
 
heatmaps consider 40bp40nt bins over tsscentered windows unless otherwise noted each position in a heatmap gives the number of reads or other features overlapping with that bin heatmap images were generated using partek version 66 43 twodimensional plots unless otherwise noted consider 10bp10nt bins and report average values across all tsss considered to test enrichment of chipseq signal at datss positions chipseq coverage was found in a 100bp window about all identified datsss equivalent regions were found at genes without datsss by selecting a 100bp window shifted downstream of tsss by the median observed tssdatss distance 507 nts the significance of enrichment was then calculated by wilcoxon test comparing the two groups
 
to generate the gene tsscentered panels in s5 s6 s7 and s8 figs uatss and datsscentered plots were first reflected across uatss and datss positions respectively to orient these plots relative to gene tsss these plots were then translated upstream or downstream by the median distances observed between gene tsss and uatsss or between gene tsss and datsss across calls made in t47da12 cells

two replicate had and lad lines were initiated from the nnih hs heterogeneous stock 71 ie with different parents in two different colonies and selectively bred using within family selection and a rotational breeding program 10 during selection both lines were given free access to food water and a 10 vv ethanol solution the selection criteria for the had lines were consumption of at least five point zero g of ethanolkg body weightday with an ethanol to water ratio of at least 21 while lad rats were required to drink less than one point five gkgday with an ethanol to water ratio of less than 051 bidirectional selection for ap was repeated continuously for thirty generations followed by generations of selection that were interspersed with relaxed selection sixty generations were completed at the time of sampling of which forty were for and against ap in each replicate
 
spleen samples from ten alcohol naive rats 5 males and five females of each line and replicate were collected and stored at 80c dna was isolated using gentra puregene kits qiagen redwood city ca usa about twentyfive mg of spleen was homogenized in cell lysis solution followed by proteinase k digestion rnase a incubation and dna precipitation as described in manufactures protocol dna purity 260280 ratio measured 179194 with the majority 185 the dna yield was more than two hundred g in most samples one of the samples was removed from the analysis as genetic testing indicated its id was incorrectly recorded
 
individual dna from each rat was sequenced in the iu center for medical genomics using an abi solid 5500xl platform using a 3575 bp paired end fragments protocol in the first replicate and 75bp single end protocol in the second we reached an approximate depth of 5x per sample and 50x across each line within a replicate reads were mapped to the reference genome rattusnorvegicusrnor5071 using lifescope  duplicate reads were removed using picard  and reads with mapping quality  eight were also removed variants snps were called using gatk multisample variant calling 8 reads with coverage greater than four times the expected read depth across all samples were removed as possible copy number variants or other genome duplication events a 03 sequencing error rate was assumed 72 and screened for by combining all samples and if the total number of snps at that location was less than 03 of total reads the location was removed
 
allele frequencies in each line and replicate at a given locus were estimated as the total number of nonreference nr alleles present across samples within a replicate to the total reads at that locus n for estimating ld and hb genotypes were called for each individual at each polymorphic locus gametic phase disequilibrium or linkage disequilibrium ld was estimated pair wise between all polymorphic loci on the same chromosome as the coefficient of determination r2 using the iterative method 33 only loci with a minor allele frequency maf  10 were used to calculate ld to avoid issues related to rare alleles in addition following the methods of wang and associates 73 haplotype blocks hb were defined as chromosomal regions flanked by at least one historical recombination event termed the four gamete rule fgr 23 and as implemented by haploview 43 in brief blocks 25 are searched from the start of a region by sequential addition of the next locus the number of unique gametes between the initial and last locus are counted when all four gametes are observed between the last locus and any of previous loci in the block the position of the last locus is regarded as the putative starting point of a new block and the block size is determined as the sequence length between the start and end positions the only explanation for observing all four gametes between a pair of loci is the occurrence of at least one historical recombination event 23 while strict use of the fgr would require only one recombination event to infer an hb for purposes of examination of hb as units of selection a more conservative minor gamete frequency mgf was used increasing the mgf results in larger hb the mgf was therefore increased until a near continuous spine of hb resulted as defined and visualized by haploview a continuous spine results when nearly all snps are contained in hb and a new hb starts where the previous ends this process of finding a continuous spine will tend to only find common hb which for our purposes is the desired outcome however for purposes of comparison of hb size to the nihhss see methodsestimation of allele frequencies in the nihhs parent lines we used a mgf of 625 116 because allele frequencies in that population were coarse with the smallest expected nonzero mgf  12n for n  eight lines
 
the initial allele frequency was estimated from the parent lines that composed the nihhs the eight parent lines of the nihhs ie aci bn buf f344 m520 mr wky and wn were recently sequenced rat genome sequencing and mapping consortium 2013 we downloaded the genomic data erp001923 from the ncbi sequence read archive sra and mapped the sequence to the reference genome used in this study rattusnorvegicusrnor5071 our results were essentially the same of that of the consortium except we detected that some snp loci were still segregating within some lines although the differences were minor allele frequency was estimated within each line and locus as the number of snp reads at that locus over the read depth at that locus these were then averaged over the eight parent lines we refer to the in silico nihhs as the nihhss line
 
signatures of selection ss were detected as excessive differentiation measured by wrights fst statistic 23 but estimated as the intraclass correlation due to between line differentiation  based on a simple extension of the method presented by weir and cockerham 15 weir and cockerham 1984 showed that it is possible to define fstatistics based on the method of moments from the analysis of variance in a nested analysis variance components can be estimated for 1 between population 2 within population between individuals and 3 between alleles within individuals and 4 total variation based on various ratios of these they defined f f and  which correspond to wrights fit fis and fst because fst estimated as  was defined as a ratio of the between population variance component to the total variance we refer to this statistic as an intraclass correlation as defined by fisher 74 the fst statistic is usually found in running windows of arbitrary size 17 we chose a window size based on the coefficient of determination r2 between loci as suggested by weir and colleagues 34 the quantity 1 r2 is the proportion of the covariation between loci that is independent of linkage with an r2  50 the majority of covariation is independent thus at a minimum the distance between loci should be greater than r2  50 we chose a more conservative critical value of r2  25 ld25 the median number of snps between loci associated with the ld25 was used as the size of the sliding window for the fst statistic details of the method are as follows
 
following weir and cockerham 15 the fst statistic was estimated based on the following linear model where y is the presence or absence of the snp at the qth locus in the mth gamete yijkmlirijsijkgijkm1 for the ith line i  12 of the jth replicate j  12 in the kth sample k  110 and mth gamete m  12 the expected mean squares for this model in terms of drift variance was given by muir 32 from the analysis of variance variance components for each term were estimated for each locus containing a polymorphic snp the fst statistic was estimated as  in sliding windows of size w following equation ten from weir and cockerham 15 for multiple loci as qq1wl2qq1wlq2rlq2srlq2grliq2
 
statistical significance was determined by genome wide permutations 75 whereby the design classifications were randomized onto gametes following which the statistic was evaluated at all loci across the genome and the largest value recorded this process was repeated 100000 times among the ordered 100000 largest values the genome wide critical  value gwp corresponded to the p largest ordered  value because all snp locations across the genome were included in the permutation analysis the critical value is automatically adjusted for multiple comparisons as an additional level of caution permutations were also conducted at the individual level where the design classifications were randomized onto individuals with their complete set of genotypes across loci this method of permutation preserves the covariance structure among the gametes within individuals these were also permutated 100000 times and the gwp estimated in the same manner the larger critical value from the two permutation methods was used as the gwp
 
to give a global perspective of the genomewide magnitude and spatial distribution of ss we created a manhattan plot based on the    values on chrs 120 and the x the plot was generated using matlab eight point three the mathworks inc natick ma usa
 
significant    values in windows of running averages were annotated by gene regions gene locations and regions were based on the current ensemble annotation of the rat genome  version five point zero and included exon untranslated region utr and intron the promoter region was defined as a 10kb domain upstream of the transcriptional start site in order to capture the proximal promoter closelylinked enhancer elements and regions subject to epigenetic regulation
 
critical cisacting splicing elements within the intron include the 5 splice site the branch point the polypyrimidine tract and the 3 splice site were included in the intronexon junction fragment although the branch point is most commonly found within the last forty nucleotides nt of the intron its position is highly variable and has been mapped up to four hundred nt away from the 3 splice site 76 77 analysis of several hundred human exons indicates that the majority of branch points are located within one hundred and fifty bp of the 3 splice site 78 to ensure we captured the majority of branch point sequences we divided introns into two components a intronexon junction regions jr 150bp upstream and downstream of each exon for multiexon genes and b intronnon junction injr regions which capture intronic sequences that extend beyond one hundred and fifty bp from the exon the jr include some but not necessarily all alternative splice sites while the injr may pick up additional alternative spice sites and other noncoding regulatory factors such as enhancers and noncoding rna binding elements
 
effects of ss in the exonal region were determined by the ensembl variant effect predictor vep  79 which uses the sorting intolerant from tolerant sift software  80 to predict the effect of snps in protein function 81 the current version of ensembl vep uses rat genome rnor60 assembly we therefore convert our data from rnor50 to rnor60 using ensembl assembly converter  before uploading data to vep to predict the effects of promoter ss on altering putative transcription factor binding we retrieved twenty bp of flanking sequence 10bp on each side of the ss 21bp total from the rgsc rnor50 rat genome assembly and put the sequence into promo  82 the had and lad sequences were analyzed separately for putative transcription factor binding sites and additions or loss of cpg dinucleotide for the prediction of rna binding factors on junctional ss similar to promoter ss 10bp of flanking rna sequence converted t to u on each side of the junctional ss were input to  83 84 using the model of pwmslog odds and threshold of six point for genes expressed from the watson strand we used the published sequence for genes expressed on the crick strand we used the reverse complement the had and lad sequences were analyzed separately for putative rna factor binding sites
 
pathways of biological interest were defined and visualized using qiagens ingenuity pathway analysis ipa qiagen redwood city ca usa wwwqiagencomingenuity we did not do an enrichment or overrepresentation analysis common in rnaseq studies because as opposed to an rna based expression analysis where all pathway members have the opportunity to be expressed at the dna level not all genes in a pathway may have had the opportunity to be selected upon due to lack of new mutation within those genes or intolerance of those genes to new mutations ie pathway analysis would fail to detect pathways under selection if selection did not have an opportunity to function because no new mutations were present to act upon as such pathway analysis is expected to exhibit a large number of false negatives and should not be used to prioritize pathways found via number of genes with ss but it is also reasonable to assume that multiple genes from a crucial pathway could be under selection and contribute to collaborative function

wholegenome shotgun sequencing and assembly of the p fijiensis genome were done using sanger sequencing of three differentsized libraries 3 and 8kb plasmids and 40kb fosmids as described previously for z tritici 17 and other species 82 the initial version one assembly was improved by aligning the physical scaffolds to a genetic linkage map constructed using joinmap v four point zero software 83 to analyze the segregation data for three hundred and twentytwo markers that were scored on one hundred and thirtyfive progeny of the cross between isolates cirad86 and cirad 139a 81 for each molecular locus a goodnessoffit analysis was performed to test for deviation from the expected 11 segregation ratio at a 1 significance level linkage groups were established using a minimum lod score of nine point zero and final mapping was achieved by combining two or more linkage groups belonging to the same chromosome the order of the markers on each chromosome was determined using a minimum lod score of 10 recombination threshold of 04 jump of 50 ripple value of one default and haldanes mapping function as parameters in cases of uncertainty some markers were removed and the order was recalculated until a more stable order was achieved
 
three methods were used to identify the p fijiensis repetitive sequences repeated sequences in the genome were identified de novo using recon 84 and the kmer based method repeatscout 85 a custom set of repeats and the repbase update library of two hundred and thirtyfour fungal repeats 86 were then used to mask the p fijiensis genome using repeatmasker  87
 
repeat families with ten or more elements identified by repeatscout were annotated and classified into categories based on the presence of protein domains blast 88 structural features including long terminal repeats ltrs and terminal inverted repeats tirs were verified using the emboss 89 software package sequences with no known proteins or structural features were grouped into the unclassified category
 
identification and annotation of proteincoding genes were performed using the jgi annotation pipeline which takes multiple inputs scaffolds ests and known genes runs several analytical tools for gene prediction and annotation and deposits the results in the jgi fungal genome portal mycocosm  90 for further analysis and manual curation
 
several geneprediction programs falling into three general categories were used to annotate the repeatmasked assembly as described by ohm et al 19 the resulting set of putative genes was then filtered for the best models based on est and similarity support to produce a nonredundant representative set this representative set of filtered gene models from the automated annotation pipeline was subject to further analysis and manual curation as described by goodwin et al for z tritici 17 and by ohm et al 82 for more recently sequenced species measures of model quality included proportions of the models complete with start and stop codons 88 of models those that were consistent with ests 30 of models and those supported by similarity with proteins from the ncbi nr database 74 of models as summarized in s8 table
 
functional annotations for all predicted gene models were made using signalp 91 tmhmm 92 interproscan 93 and blastp 88 against the nr swissprot  kegg 94 and kog 95 databases as described by ohm et al 19 multigene families were predicted with the markov clustering algorithm mcl 96 to cluster the proteins using blastp alignment scores between proteins as a similarity metric functional annotations are summarized in s9 table manual curation of the automated annotations was performed using the webbased interactive editing tools of the jgi genome portal to assess predicted gene structures assign gene functions and report supporting evidence gene models predicted by the jgi annotation pipeline were also analyzed using the program blast2go 97 with an evalue of  106 blast2go assigns go terms based on the blast definitions comparisons between groups of genes for enrichment of go terms were done by using fishers exact test implemented in the blast2go program
 
potential secreted proteins were identified with a python script made to run all gene models through signalp three point zero 98 and subsequently filtered for proteins that had no transmembrane domains no signal anchor motifs were fewer than three hundred amino acids in length and had at least four cysteine residues the gene models that fulfilled these criteria were considered as potential ssps

tissue strips were transfected with mouse tspear sirna sc270602 santa cruz biotechnology santa cruz ca or control sirna sc36869 santa cruz biotechnology all reagents required for transfection were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology sirna transfection reagent sc29528 sirna transfection medium sc36868 transfection was performed as previously described 43 and following seven hours of transfection tissue strips were maintained in 6well plate with two ml supplemented wem for an additional twentyfour hours following twentyfour hours two tissue strips from each treatment group were used for average hair bulb measurement in detail two hundred l of 2 low melt agarose solution agarose ii midsci mo usa dissolved in sterile dulbeccos phosphate buffered saline dpbs were used to coat the bottom of 6well glass bottom plate mattek ashland ma dorsal tissue strips were positioned parallel to the bottom of the plate and embedded in agar one ml of wem was gently added to the wells the 6well plate was then placed in a prewarmed incubation chamber 37c 5 co2 of a zeiss axio observerz1 microscope axiovision software 482 sp3 was used to select and mark multiple nonoverlapping fields of view on each tissue strip covering a significant area of each strip fluorescent images were captured using an automatic exposure time and an excitation wavelength of four hundred and seventy nm data were analyzed in a single blinded manner raw data collected were given an alphanumeric cipher and were subsequently analyzed by a blinded investigator unaware of the conditions tested or grouping in each hair follicle three horizontal measurements were done in the area of hair bulb and proximal hair shaft the average of those three measurements was calculated for each hair follicle from the two different treatment group and was defined as average hair bulb diameter three independent experiments were done with three different mice in each mouse two skin samples from each of the two treatment groups tspearsirna vs controlsirna were used for average hair bulb measurement
 
in addition three strips from each treatment group were collected twentyfour hours following transfection for rna isolation rneasy kit qiagen valencia ca and validation of tspear silencing for reverse transcription we used an iscript cdna synthesis kit biorad hercules ca with one g of rna as starting material the resulting cdna was diluted 110 with nuclease free water and five l of the diluted solution was used as template for subsequent qpcr reactions
 
quantitative realtime pcr was performed on an applied biosystems seven thousand three hundred using taqman universal pcr master mix applied biosystems carlsbad ca template cdna and taqman primers taqman primers were ordered from life technologies tspear mm00455327m1 and gapdh mm99999915g1 which served to normalize data life technologiesinvitrogen grand island ny to quantify notch1 expression we used 2x sybr green qpcr master mix biotool houstontx and primer bank id 13177625a1 notch1 primers while rplp0 served as an internal control forward primer 5gagattcgggatatgctgttgg3 and reverse primer 5cgggtcctagaccagtgttct3
 
finally tissue strips from each treatment group were frozen in liquid nitrogen fortyeight hours after transfection for immunohistochemistry studies seven mthick cryosections were prepared and stored at 80c until use for tspear protein expression cryosections were first airdried for ten min and then fixed in acetone at 20c for another ten min after air drying the slides were washed three times for five min in pbs following twenty min incubation of cryosections with 2 goat serum in pbs cryosections were incubated overnight at 4c with the rabbit antitspear monoclonal antibody abcam cambridge ma at 150 dilution with 2 goat serum in pbs solution this was followed by incubation with alexa fluor five hundred and sixtyeight goat antirabbit secondary antibody life technologiesinvitrogen for fortyfive min at rt in 1200 dilution with 2 goat serum in pbs solution incubation steps were interspersed with three washes five min each with pbs then sections were embedded and counterstained with dapi for the identification of cell nuclei
 
for massonfontana histochemistry cryosections were air dried and fixed in ethanolacetic acid the sections were washed in trisbuffered saline tbs and distilled water several times cryosections were treated with ammoniacal silver solution thermo fisher scientific carlsbad ca for forty min at 56c in the dark after washing in distilled water the sections were treated with 5 aqueous sodium thiosulphate sigmaaldrich st louis mo for one min then the sections were washed in running tap water for three min and were counterstained with haematoxylin for fortyfive seconds after washing in distilled water sections were dehydrated and mounted in eukitt sigmaaldrich st louis mo tspear immunoreactivity and melanin content by massonfontana histochemistry were compared between test and control sections by quantitative histomorphometry as previously described 4344 using nih image software nih bethesda md usa
 
for apoptosis detection a kit for deadend fluorometric tunel system analysis promega madison wi usa was used briefly cryosections were air dried and fixed in 4 formaldehyde in pbs for twentyfive minutes following several washing steps in pbs permeabilization step with 02 triton in pbs was conducted for five min following several washing steps in pbs sections were equilibrated with equilibration buffer for 510 min and then incubated with tdt reaction mix for sixty minutes at 37c following stop reaction step and washing steps with pbs sections were embedded and counterstained with dapi for the identification of cell nuclei

we included fourteen study centers from the ccfr and gecco as described in the s1 text and s1 and s2 tables all colorectal cancer cases were defined as colorectal adenocarcinoma and confirmed by medical records pathologic reports or death certificates we included advanced colorectal adenoma a welldefined colorectal cancer precursor 70 71 from two studies s1 text advanced adenoma was defined as an adenoma one cm or larger in diameter andor with tubulovillous villous or highgrade dysplasiacarcinomainsitu histology colorectal adenoma cases were confirmed by medical records histopathology or pathologic reports controls for adenoma cases had a clean sigmoidoscopic or colonoscopic examination all participants provided informed consent and studies were approved by their respective institutional review boards
 
average sample and snp call rates and concordance rates for blinded duplicates have been previously published 3 in brief genotyped snps were excluded based on call rate  98 lack of hardyweinberg equilibrium in controls hwe p  one x 104 and low minor allele frequency maf005 we imputed the autosomal snps of all studies to the northern europeans from utah ceu population in hapmap ii snps were restricted based on perstudy minor allele count  five and imputation accuracy r2  03 after imputation and qualitycontrol qc exclusion approximately 27m snps were used in analysis
 
all analyses were restricted to individuals of european ancestry defined as samples clustering with the utah residents with northern and western european ancestry from the ceph collection population in principal component analysis 72 including the hapmap ii populations as reference
 
all information on basic demographics and environmental risk factors were collected through interviews or through selfadministered questionnaires data for all studies were centrally harmonized at the data coordinating center we used the riskfactor information at the reference time which varied across studies s1 text a multistep dataharmonization procedure which is described in detail in hutter et al 29 was applied to reconcile differences in individual study questionnaires we converted consumption of alcoholic beverages into grams of alcohol per day gday by summing the alcohol content of each beverage consumed per day to test if the categorical or continuous variable fitted the association between alcohol intake and crc risk better we used akaike information criterion aic to compare both models with our sample size a model with an aic that is six points smaller than the other model is considered a better fitting model32 according to this analysis and consistent with previously described risk profiles 16 17 1922 73 we grouped study participants as nonoccasional drinkers drinking  one gday lighttomoderate drinkers drinking 128 gday and heavy drinkers drinking 28 gday one standard drinking is approximately equal to fourteen grams of alcohol we coded these categories using indicator variables for the genomewide interaction analysis smoking history was defined as never and eversmoking packyears of smoking was calculated by multiplying the average number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by smoking duration years smoking history ever vs never smoking and packyears treated as a continuous variable of smoking were used in genomewide interaction analysis separately
 
statistical analyses of all data were conducted centrally at the gecco coordinating center on individuallevel data to ensure a consistent analytical approach unless otherwise indicated we adjusted for age at the reference time sex when appropriate center when appropriate and the first three principal components from eigenstrat to account for potential population substructure the alcohol and smoking variables were coded as described above each directly genotyped snp was coded as 0 1 or two copies of the variant allele for imputed snps we used the expected number of copies of the variant allele the dosage which has been shown to give unbiased test statistics 74 genotypes were treated as continuous variables ie logadditive effects each study was analyzed separately using logistic regression models and studyspecific results were combined using fixedeffects metaanalysis methods to obtain summary odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis across studies we calculated the heterogeneity pvalues using woolfs test 75 quantilequantile qq plots were assessed to determine whether the distribution of the pvalues was consistent with the null distribution except for the extreme tail subjects with missing data for snps or environmental factors were excluded from the relevant analyses considering the potential malefemale difference in alcohol metabolism76 77 and the different levels of alcohol consumption between sexes we conducted the genomewide interaction analysis for alcohol separately for men and women and used fixed effects metaanalysis to combine their results all analyses were conducted using the r software version 301
 
two statistical methods that leverage snps and environmental factors interaction ge interaction were used to detect potential disease associated loci first we used conventional casecontrol logistic regression analysis including ge interaction terms as the alcohol consumption variable has three categories there are two interaction terms in the statistical models based on an increasing number of publications 7883 providing a detailed discussion on the appropriate genomewide significance threshold which all arrive at similar values in the range of five x 107to five x 108 for european populations we decided to use an alpha level of five x 108 as the genomewide significance threshold assuming about one million independent tests across the genome 0051000000  five x 108 for significant results we used permutation approach to determine the empirical pvalue we defined the number of permutation needed as 1pvalue ie for a pvalue of five x 108 15e08  20000000 we permutated the casecontrol status 1pvalue times and calculated the p values for the interaction from each metaanalyses to calculate the permuted pvalue
 
second we used our recently developed cocktail method55 in brief this method consists of twosteps a screening step to prioritize snps and a testing step for gxe interaction for the screening step we ranked and prioritized variants through a genomewide screen of each of the 27m snps referred to as g by the maximum of the two test statistics from marginal association testing of gs on disease risk 84 and correlation testing between g and exposure e in cases and controls combined85 based on the ranks of these snps from screening we used a weighted hypothesis framework to partition snps into ordered groups and assigned each group an alphalevel cutoff with higher ranked groups from the screening stage having less stringent alphalevel cutoffs for interaction 86 87 the second step of the cocktail method is the testing step we used either casecontrol cc or caseonly co logistic regression to calculate a pvalue for the interaction if the g was assigned based on its low marginal association p value in the screening tests we used co test if it was ranked because of a low correlation screening pvalue we used cc tests we compared the test step pvalue to the alphalevel cutoff for each snp in a given group
 
we calculated absolute risks for each genotype of the snp showing significant ge interaction briefly based upon the surveillance epidemiology and end results seer ageadjusted colorectal cancer incidence rate denoted by i between 19822011 among the white population of fortytwo point nine per 100000 men and women per year we estimated the reference incidence rate of colorectal cancer denoted by ireference using the following formula ireference  ipaa none  oraa nonepaa none  oraa nonepaa none  oraa epaa e  oraa epaa e  oraa epaa e where pgenotype e or none is the prevalence of lighttomoderate drinking or nonoccasional drinking in each corresponding genotype category among controls noncases based on this reference incidence rate of colorectal cancer ie ireference we further calculated absolute colorectal cancer incidence rates within each subgroup defined by genotype of the snp according to a lighttomoderate drinking or nonoccasional drinking by multiplying the ireference with each corresponding or bootstrap methods were used to calculate the 95 ci of absolute risk estimates 88
 
we used different types of gene expression data to examine putative expression of genes identified in our genomewide interaction analysis and to determine biological plausibility that the variants identified might impact crc risk first we searched the genotypetissue expression project gtex portal  and the human protein atlas  to establish whether the implicated genes and corresponding proteins are expressed in human colonrectal tissues second we used several eqtl databases including the browser at university of chicago  genevar gene expression variation at the wellcome trust sanger institute  42 haploreg  pmid22064851 and the gtex portal version 4 pmid 26484569 to investigate whether any of the implicated snps may impact the expression of the nearby genes a ciseqtl analysis was also performed in tcga coad data in three hundred and fiftysix caucasian samples that have demographic and clinical data for 15008 genes s1 text third we analyzed expression data for the implicated genes from thirtyfive pairs of colorectal tumornormal tissue samples included in the colocare cohort s2 text as well as expression data from the cancer genome atlas tcga  in fifty pairs of colorectal adenocarcinomanormal tissue samples we searched the ucsc cancer genomics browser  3739 to examine whether the implicated genes showed evidence of differential expression in colorectal tumor tissue and normal tissue last we used the publically available data in the gene expression omnibus site  89 90 and the gene expression data from normal colon n  33 and tumor n  28 tissue in the colocare cohort s2 text to investigate whether the expression of implicated genes are correlated with alcoholsmoking history
 
we explored potential functional annotations for the snps that showed evidence for interactions with either smoking or alcohol in our genomewide interaction analyses as detailed in s1 text we queried multiple bioinformatics databases using the ucsc genome browser  haploreg  and literature review of published enhancer signatures of colon cancer

all participants gave written informed consent for tissue donation through the sample collection registry for quality control of biological and environmental specimens and assay development and testing protocol registered with clinicaltrialsgov number nct01087307 and approved by the nih institutional review board at the national institute of environmental health sciences niehs protocol  10e0063 we obtained four mm diameter skin punch biopsies from the left and right lateral forearms and hips and whole blood from two caucasian male donors ages fiftyeight and sixtytwo fig 1 areas for biopsy were identified as free of moles hair and previous scars lateral forearm was away from area that would be covered by a watch hip area was under area that would be covered by shorts but away from groin the skin was sectioned into approximately six parts and the sections were allowed to adhere to a cell culture dish dulbeccos modified eagles medium gibco 11965118 supplemented with 1x nonessential amino acids thermofisher 11140050 10 cosmic calf serum hyclone sh30087 10 amniomax c100 supplement gibco 12556015 and 100gml primocin invitrogen antpm1 and the cultures were incubated at 37c in a 5 carbon dioxide containing incubator fibroblasts were selected for their ability to grow well in culture with high cloning efficiency 45 they were identified based on their elongated shape and ability to grow adhered to the tissue culture dishes in the presence of serumcontaining media s1 fig it took approximately 34 weeks for confluent fibroblast growth from the tissue fragments the fibroblasts were harvested diluted and plated to obtain singlecell derived clones the clones were expanded in culture for five to six additional passages 46 weeks to obtain one hundred and six cells and genomic dna was extracted dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen venous blood for dna isolation was collected in five eight point five ml paxgene blood dna tubes preanalytixqiagen valencia ca
 
we used the kapa hyper kapa biosystems kit for whole genome sequencing wgs library preparation size selection of constructed libraries was performed using pippin prep sage science dna libraries were used to obtain pairedend one hundred rapid v2 chemistry or one hundred and twentyfive bp v4 chemistry reads from hiseq two thousand five hundred sequencer illumina each dna library was sequenced on four lanes to get an average coverage of 40x to 60x for whole genomes and 100x to 200x for whole exomes wes s1 table for whole exome 37 mb target size sequencing nextera rapid capture exome kit illumina was used to prepare the library prior to sequencing the raw fastq files were filtered to keep only read pairs with an average base quality score of twenty or more and were then aligned to the reference human genome grch37 using bwamem0710 64 using the default parameters and the resulting bam files were merged duplicate reads were removed from the resulting bam files using markduplicates from picard tools the bam files were processed according to the genome analysis toolkit gatk best practices pipeline 39 65 the length of the genome with coverage greater than or equal to 10x was estimated using the bedtools genomecoveragebed command 66 s1 table the final bam files and complete lists of somatic mutation calls in wgs and wes samples have been deposited into dbgap approved study under accession number phs001182v1p1
 
the published method sctea 67 was applied to detect insertions of retrotransposons l1 alu and sva in ten fibroblast clones at least five supporting read pairs and the score higher than zero point six were required the germline nonreference insertions were filtered out using the blood genome from the same donor thirteen raw insertion candidates were manually inspected using the integrative genome viewer and two candidates remained as a final call set s2 table the clonality of each event was estimated by calculating the ratio of discordant reads pairs supporting the insertion ie repeatanchored mate read ram counts to the sum of the ram counts and the number of concordant read pairs across the insertion breakpoint ie those supporting the noninsertion allele the top high confidence insertion candidate found in the clone d1lh l11 resides in a genomic region with large tandem duplication in the germline genome thus having an elevated sequencing depth with poor read mappability whereas the other candidate found in the d2rf clone l12 resides in a genomic region with the expected depth and good mappability to more accurately estimate the clonality of the event like l11 we adjusted the number of concordant read pairs by the relative sequencing depth to the genomic average depth and recalculated the allele frequency with an assumption that the insertion allele exists in only one of the many duplicated genomic regions this copy number adjusted clonality provides us an upper bound of the event clonality s2 fig
 
largescale clonal copy number changes in the clones were detected using the varscan2 copy number tool on pileup files generated using samtools mpileup command 27 68 this tool detects changes in coverage in the dna samples from the clones as compared to their corresponding blood sample circular binary segmentation was applied to the output using the dnacopy package in r 28 69 70 s3 fig s4 fig and s3 table
 
somatic structural changes in the form of large deletions inversions duplications and translocations were detected using the software delly 29 using the default settings s3 fig s4 fig and s4 table alignments of blood dna reads were used as the matched normal to detect clonespecific somatic events centromeric and telomeric regions were excluded from the analyses for each sample a structural variation event was called if  30 of the reads in the region supported the call and there were zero reads supporting the event in the corresponding blood sample s4 table the structural variations were further validated by pcr as described below and any variants detected in blood dna were discarded s5 fig
 
single nucleotide variations snvs for wgs samples were analyzed using three mutation calling tools the haplotype caller from gatk 39 varscan2 somatic mutation caller from washington university st louis 27 and mutect from the broad institute of harvard and mit 40 snvs were called somatic if they were present in the clone and were not detected in the blood of the same donor varscan2 and mutect were run using the alignment files from whole blood from a donor as the normal for each clone isolated from this donor the snv calls were limited to regions with a minimum of 10x coverage with at least three reads supporting the mutation call the list of snvs generated were filtered to remove calls that match known dbsnps version 138 and calls that fall within known simple repeat regions ucsc genome browser hg19 build the consensus between the three callers was taken and filtered further for allele frequency to provide the final mutation calls calls with an allele frequency between 45 and 55 were denoted as heterozygous mutations and those with an allele frequency  90 were denoted as homozygous mutations homozygous snvs may arise in the genome as mutations in genomic regions with copy number  one eg x chromosome or autosome region heterozygous for a deletionor by loss of heterozygosity following a mutation in the autosomes mutations with allele frequencies not falling within these criteria were discarded since the samples sequenced were clonal in nature 61 to 73 of the snvs called by the three mutation callers were contained within these allele frequencies s6 fig s6 table and s7 table
 
varscan2 was also used to annotate loss of heterozygosity loh events in the clones as compared to their respective blood samples the loh events in the clones were expected to have an allele frequency  90 and between 45 and 55 in the corresponding blood samples s5 table
 
to detect shared snvs between two or more samples the snv calls by mutect were compared for all samples from the two donors respectively analyses of allele frequencies for mutation calls by all three callers demonstrated that mutect detects the highest fraction of somatic snvs the resulting snvs were filtered by allele frequency such that calls between 45 and 55 or alleles with frequency  90 in either of the shared samples were further validated as described below only one snv was confirmed to be present in both clones from the left forearm in donor2 and two snvs were validated to be identical between the clones from the left and right forearms of donor2 s7 fig
 
mutations were annotated for their presence within exons and for their functional consequences and potential roles in cancers using the software annovar 71 and cravat 72 s6 table
 
the bulk fibroblasts that outgrew from the initial biopsies from all four sites forearms and hips for the two donors were used for deep sequencing of the exome with approximately 100200x coverage s1 table and aligned to the human genome as described above mutect was used to call somatic snvs in these samples a large fraction 264387 of the snvs from the bulk cells were found to be identical to the snvs detected by the three mutations callers in exomes of the respective clones s6 table thus further corroborating the snv calls in the clones
 
the bulk cells derived from the biopsy from the left forearm of donor two showed a bimodal distribution of variant allele frequencies with the two peaks at 510 and 3545 seventynine of the eightythree snvs present in the exons of d2lf left forearm donor 2 were present in the bulk sample for the left forearm fortynine of these snvs had allele frequencies  40 s8 fig s6 table and s8 table these observations indicate that the biopsy segment for the left forearm for donor two primarily contained one clonal lineage from which the clone d2lf was derived in the seven other bulk samples the majority of the snvs called were between five and 15 s8 fig and s8 table these allele frequencies can be explained if each biopsy segment contained a minimum of ten clonal lineages based on this we estimated the minimum expected exonic mutation loads in a given biopsy segment by multiplying the number of mutations detected in the exome of the clones derived from the bulk cells by ten s9 table
 
the average length of the telomeric repeats was estimated using telseq 73 in newborns the average length of the telomere restriction fragments trfs has been estimated to be approximately eleven kb 74 75 trfs have been shown to contain one kb dna between the restriction site and telomeric repeats in order to compare the telomere lengths in our samples to newborns we therefore added one kb to the lengths estimated by telseq fibroblasts have been shown to lose 50100 bp of the telomeres every generation 75 since each clone rose from a single cell with at least twenty cell generations we can assess that telomeres in the progenitor cell were two kb longer this implies that the fibroblast cells that gave rise to the clones have 45 kb trfs based on this we can calculate that the cells underwent a minimum of sixty to seventy divisions since the individuals were born since the diploid human genome is six x one hundred and nine nucleotides we calculate the mutation rate per nucleotide in the genome per cell division as rateperntpercelldivisionmutationloadcelldivisionsdiploidgenoment
 
because the number of prenatal cell divisions is unknown this calculation represents the maximum estimate of the rate therefore we also calculated mutation rate per genome per year as another characteristics of mutation accumulation s10 table
 
primers to amplify regions containing somatic mutations and loh events were designed using primerblast such that approximately five hundred to one thousand five hundred bp region spanning the mutated base would be amplified 76 six to ten mutations in the exons of each clone were chosen for amplification and sanger sequencing the corresponding blood dna was also analyzed to ascertain whether the mutations annotated as somatic were present in the blood germline one hundred and two snvs with potential functional consequences were chosen for validation of these eightyseven snvs were validated as somatic we were unable to pcr amplify and get high quality sanger sequencing results for the remaining snvs due to difficulty obtaining primers unique to the region being amplified none of the somatic events were identified as germline mutations in both clone and blood s6 table
 
loh events that were either present in protein coding regions or were in regions with cnvs were taken for validation by pcr and sanger sequencing only ten such events were validated due to constraints with the amount of dna available and difficulties in obtaining primers specific to the genomic regions the loh event was considered somatic if it was identified as a heterozygous allele in blood dna and as a homozygous mutant in the clone s5 table
 
structural variants were validated by pcr using primers flanking the novel junction formed and sanger sequencing the pcr product the structural change was considered somatic if it was detected in the clone and not detected in the blood dna s5 fig and s4 table the plots depicting all somatic changes in the clones were generated using rcircos 77
 
the enrichment of uvinduced mutation signatures and mutation load in the clones were calculated similar to 43 44 we use the term mutation signature in reference to the characteristics of a given mutation including the mutated residue the altered base and the nucleotides that surround the residue that occur more frequently than expected with random mutations in genomic dna the signatures analyzed in this paper are listed in table two point
 
the mutated residue is capitalized in the center of the motif in the detailed signature motif possible nucleotides for a position are show in brackets separated by 
 
for uvsignatures ct changes in the context of the ycn motif where n is any base and y is pyrimidine t or c and tc changes in the 5 t in the context of the ntt motif were analyzed example of the calculation for enrichment of mutations within the ntt motif is presented below where the context is derived from 41nucleotides region containing the mutated residue in the center
 
for each motif the reverse complement was also used in the calculations the use of nucleotide context immediately surrounding the mutation rather than the wholegenome helps to account for localized preference of mutagenesis stemming from small range scanning by mutagenic enzymes such as apobec or the preference of lesion occurrence lesion repair as well as other factors including epigenomic features influencing mutagenesis within localized genomic regions 78 79 these calculations do not exclude any specific genomic region but rather use the area in each sample where the mutations actually happened with large numbers of mutations this approach gives results similar to calculations using wholegenome context 43
 
to statistically determine the overrepresentation of the uvsignature mutations a onesided fishers exact test was performed the ratio of the number of c  t for ycn and ncg or t c for ntt changes that occurred within or out of their respective motifs were compared to the ratio of c or t bases present within or out of the motifs above to correct pvalues for multiple testing the benjaminihochberg method was used
 
the minimum estimate of the number of mutations attributable to uv for both ncy and ntt motifs were calculated only for samples with enrichment  one also having corrected qvalue for enrichment  005 for samples with enrichment  one and for samples with enrichment qvalue  zero point zero five the minimum estimate of mutation load was assigned the value  zero point for example minimum mutation load for nttnct was calculated as mutloadnttnctmutationsnttnctenrichmentnttnct1enrichmentnttnct
 
mutagenesis in cpg leading to ncg ntg changes was evaluated in a similar way fig 4a and 4b and s11 table
 
total tandem cctt dinucleotide changes were calculated for each sample fig 4c and s11 table this mutation signature is known to be unique to uv and the probability of random cctt changes not by uv is extremely low 50
 
in order to assess the contributions of the 1 nucleotide in the ncg and ntt mutation motifs we also evaluated rcgrtg ycgytg rttrct and yttyct mutation signatures as described above
 
replication timing for each 1mb window of the genome was determined by taking the average of the waveletsmoothed signal the average replication timing was binned into five equal bins and the mean mutation density per mb was calculated for each bin fig 5a s10 fig and s12 table the total number of dnase i hypersensitive peaks were calculated across 1mb windows in the human genome the data was binned into five equal bins and mean mutation density was calculated for each bin bedtools suite was used to map peaks to 1mb intervals fig 5a s11 fig and s12 table variation of uvinduced mutation density with replication timing and dnasei hypersensitivity levels was also determined for ycnytn nttnct and cctt mutations s12 fig and s12 table
 
to statistically determine the overrepresentation of mutations in pyrimidines due to uv in the nontranscribed strand of genes the number of ct and tc mutations in the ycn and ntt contexts and cctt mutations were determined for both strands of transcribed genes and a one sided binomial test was performed expectation that more mutations are present on the nontranscribed strand to correct pvalues for multiple testing the benjaminihochberg method was used similar comparison was done for mutations in pyrimidines not conforming to uvsignatures fig 5b and s13 table

the performance of prs is typically improved if genetic markers are pruned for ld ldpruning procedures that ignore gwas pvalues frequently prune out the most significant snps and may reduce performance instead we use the ldclumping procedure implemented in plink 20 that chooses the most significant snp from a set of snps in ld guided by gwas pvalues after ldclumping no snps with physical distance less than 500kb have ld r2  01
 
suppose s1 is a given hp set defined based on external annotation data see section annotation datasets any snp in high ld with a snp in s1 is also considered to be an hp snp thus we expanded s1 by including all snps that were in high ld r2  08 with any snp in the original s1
 
we simulated quantitative traits with specific genetic architecture by conditioning on the genotypes of a lung cancer gwas 27 including 11924 samples of european ancestry and 485315 autosomal snps after quality control the simulation scheme is summarized in the following steps
 
we performed ldpruning implemented in plink so that no snps within 500kb were in ld at threshold r2  01 after ldpruning m  53163 autosomal snps denoted as s were left
 
denote s1 as the putative hp snp set and s2  s  s1 as the lp snp set we selected a set of five thousand causal snps denoted as c from the pruned snp set s if c is randomly selected ie s1 is not enriched with causal snps we expect  s1  c    c  s1  m snps overlapping between s1 and c thus we defined the enrichment fold change for s1 as s1ccs1m 
 
the enrichment fold change  ranged from two to four in simulations
 
we simulated quantitative traits according to yi  tc tgit  i where ts were simulated independently from a gaussian mixture distribution tn0121n022 with   zero point one here 12 22 and vari were scaled so that varyi  one point the phenotypic variances explained by the two components were h12c1201 and h22c12204 we assume the same effectsize distribution for both hp and lp causal snps but the proportions of causal snps are higher in the former than the later group under this assumption  also reflects the ratio of heritability explained at a per snp basis in the hp set compared to lp set
 
we randomly selected 10000 samples as a discovery set and 1924 as a validation set we performed gwas association analysis for all 485315 autosomal snps in the discovery sample the summary statistics were used to calculate prs for each sample in the validation sample the prediction r2 was calculated as max cor2prsi yi for 1d prs methods and max12 cor2prsi1 2 yi for 2d prs methods we repeated the simulation fifty times for each set of parameters and report the average prediction r2
 
recently finucane et al 23 reported the heritability explained by common snps in multiple functional categories for seventeen traits interestingly they found that common snps located in regions that are conserved in mammals 28 accounted for about 26 of total common snps but explained approximately 35 of total heritability in average across these traits suggesting a 135fold enrichment thus we were motivated to investigate whether snps related with the conserved regions cr may be useful for 2d prs methods we downloaded the cr annotations  identified common snps located in any cr and also identified their ld snps with r2  08 these snps are referred to as crsnps which were used as hp s1 in simulations we found 9940 crsnps overlapping with the 53163 ldpruned snps to investigate whether specific genomic locations of crsnps influence the performance of 2dprs we also performed simulations using a set s1 of random snps that has the same size and associated heritability as the crsnps
 
the wellcome trust case control consortium 30 wtccc data consisted of two control data sets 1958 cohort samples and nbs control samples and seven diseases bipolar disorder bd coronary artery disease cad crohns disease cd hypertension ht rheumatoid arthritis ra type one diabetes t1d and type two diabetes t2d since we analyzed t2d using a much larger discovery sample we did not analyze the t2d data in wtccc because cases and controls were genotyped in different batches differential errors between cases and controls might cause a serious overestimate of the risk prediction thus we performed very rigorous quality control qc by removing duplicate samples first or second degree relatives samples with missing rate greater than 5 and noneuropean samples identified from eigenstrat 35 analysis for each disease we excluded snps with maf5 missing rate 2 missing rate difference 1 between cases and controls or phwe104 in the control samples for each prs method and each disease we estimated the prediction r2 by fivefold crossvalidation
 
we analyzed three cancer gwas with individual level genotype data the bladder cancer 36 37 gwas of european ancestry including 5937 cases and 10862 controls the pancreatic cancer gwas 38 of european ancestry after excluding samples with asian or african ancestry including 5066 cases and 8807 controls and the asian nonsmoking female lung cancer gwas 39 with 5510 cases and 4544 controls after qc the bladder cancer gwas had 463559 autosomal snps and the asian lung cancer gwas had 329703 autosomal snps the pancreatic cancer gwas included samples from three studies that used different genotyping platforms for convenience we analyzed 267935 autosomal snps that overlapped in all three platforms the prediction performance was evaluated using tenfold crossvalidation
 
for t2d we downloaded the summary statistics of the diagram diabetes genetics replication and metaanalysis consortium 40 with 12171 cases and 56862 controls for two point five million snps imputed to the hapmap2 reference panel we also downloaded the gera genetic epidemiology research on adult health and aging gwas data of european ancestry with 7131 t2d patients and 49747 samples without t2d but may have other medical conditions eg 274 with cancers 254 with asthma 254 with allergic rhinitis and 124 with depression we randomly selected 5631 t2d patients and 48247 nont2d subjects from gera as discovery set performed association analysis adjusting for top ten pca scores and metaanalyzed with the summary statistics from diagram for 353196 autosomal snps overlapping between the two studies the resulting summary statistics were used to build prs risk models which were validated in the remaining one thousand five hundred t2d patients and one thousand five hundred nont2d subjects in gera
 
the pgc2 psychiatric genetics consortium schizophrenia gwas metaanalysis consisted of 34241 cases and 45604 controls 41  summary statistics were obtained by metaanalyzing all pgc2 schizophrenia gwas except the mgs 42 molecular genetics of schizophrenia subjects of european ancestry the summary statistics were used to build prs models which were validated in mgs samples with 2681 cases and two thousand six hundred and fiftythree controls
 
the tricl transdisciplinary research in cancer of the lung gwas consortium consisted of 12537 lung cancer cases and 17285 controls 43 44 we performed metaanalysis using tricl samples excluding the samples from the plco 27 prostate lung colon and ovary cohort study study the summary statistics based on 11300 cases and 15952 controls were used to build risk models which were validated in the plco lung gwas samples with 1237 cases and 1333 controls
 
for colorectal cancer we performed metaanalysis for the gecco genetics and epidemiology of colorectal cancer consortium 45 gwas data after excluding the plco gwas data the plco samples were genotyped using two different genotyping platforms with different marker densities one had approximately 500k snps and the other had only 250k snps thus we first imputed the genotypes to the hapmap2 reference panel using impute2 46 and selected snps with imputation r2  zero point nine for risk prediction the discovery sample consisted of 9719 cases and 10937 controls from nineteen studies the plco validation sample had 1000 cases and 2302 controls
 
the summary statistics for prostate cancer were obtained from the practical prostate cancer association group to investigate cancer associated alterations consortium and the gameonellipse elucidating loci involved in prostate cancer susceptibility consortium with samples from populations of european african japanese and latino ancestry 5 the discovery samples consisted of 38703 cases and 40796 controls after excluding the nci pegsus gwas samples with 4600 cases and 2941 controls which were used for validation we analyzed 536057 autosomal snps after qc that overlapped between the validation and the discovery sample summary statistics
 
for many traits gwas risk snps have been reported to show enrichment for eqtls methylation qtls meqtls and cisregulatory elements cres in addition recent studies have reported extensive genetic pleiotropy across diseases and traits eg psychiatric diseases 47 48 schizophrenia and cardiovasculardisease risk factors including blood pressure triglycerides low and highdensity lipoprotein body mass index bmi and waisttohip ratio whr 49 this information may potentially improve risk prediction if the snps identified from the secondary trait are highly enriched in the gwas of the primary trait thus we defined the hp snp set s1 using eqtl snps referred to as esnps in blood tissue specific esnps and meqtl snps referred to as mesnps snps related with cres referred to as cresnps snps related with genomic regions conserved across mammals referred to as crsnps and snps identified by pleiotropic analyses referred to as ptsnps here ld was calculated based on the genotype data of relevant ancestry in the one thousand genomes project 29 note that the availability of functional annotation data depends on tissue types however for all diseases studied in the paper we have used blood esnps and crsnps because blood esnps are enriched for gwas of all these traits and crsnps were highly enriched in many traits by a heritability partitioning analysis 23
 
blood cisesnps were identified from two largescale eqtl studies in european populations one study involved a transcriptome sequencing project of nine hundred and twentytwo subjects 50 and the other involved a microarray study of 5311 subjects 51  because of its very large sample size the second study had the power to detect esnps with even tiny effect sizes which may not have meaningful functional importance thus we included esnps with association pvalue 106 with any gene in the cis region in the second study for both asian and european lung cancer gwas data we used esnps 52 and mesnps 53 based on lung tissues for t2d we used esnps 54 and mesnps 55 based on adipose tissues  furthermore detected transsnps are much fewer than cissnps and the replication rate of transesnps was much lower than cissnps 54 suggesting that including transsnps would be unlikely to improve risk prediction thus we did not include transsnps
 
cres are regions of noncoding dna regulating the transcription of nearby genes snps located in cres may change the binding of specific transcription factors and thus the expression of the target genes typically cres are identified through chipseq experiments of histone modifications we downloaded peak data each peak represents one cre of specific sets of histone methylation markings acetylation markings and dnase i hypersensitive sites dhss from the roadmap project website for relevant cell lines for each identified cre peak we identified common snps with maf1 for prostate cancer we used the chipseq data for h3k27ac and the transcription factor tcf7l2 56 to define hp snp sets
 
the summary statistics for height 1 2 bmi and obesity 3 57 whr 58 waist circumference wc 58 hip circumference hip 58 were downloaded from the giant consortium website the summary statistics for gwas metaanalysis of cardiovasculardisease risk factors 59 including triglycerides tg lowdensity lipoprotein ldl and highdensity lipoprotein hdl were also used for 2d prs
 
we investigated whether or not each tentative hp snp set was enriched for gwas associations by examining the quantilequantile qq plot which was made for hp snps vs lp snps after ldclumping the snp sets not enriched for gwas associations were not expected to improve risk prediction in 2d prs thus for each disease we only included hp snp sets for 2d prs when they showed strong enrichment in qq plots interestingly blood esnps were enriched for almost all diseases crsnps showed modest enrichment for majority of the diseases thus blood esnps and crsnps were used for 2d prs for all diseases in addition esnps and mesnps derived in lung tissues were enriched in lung cancer gwas of both european and asian ancestry the snps related in enhancer and active promoter regions characterized by h3k4me3 h3k914ac h3k36me3 h3k4me1 h3k9ac and h3k9me3 were enriched for gwas associations but snps related with the repressive regions characterized by h3k27me3 were not thus we included snps related with these enhancer and active promoter regions for 2d prs dhs snps were not strongly enriched and thus were excluded recently we have shown significantly shared genetic component between lung cancer and bladder cancer risk 60 thus we also used hp snps derived based on lung tissues or cell lines for predicting bladder cancer risk furthermore we found that snps identified through pleiotropic analysis were enriched in multiple diseases for example snps with pvalue 0001 in gwas of height hdl ldl tc tg wc obesity hip and t2d were enriched in lung cancer gwas because our 2d prs methods required a relatively large number of hp snps to achieve improvement we combined the snps with pvalue 103 or 102 in at least one trait into a hp snp set referred as pt0001 or pt001
 
for wtccc and three cancer gwas data sets with individual genotype data we used kfold crossvalidation to estimate prediction r2 here k  five for wtccc data and k  ten for cancer gwas data we were interested in testing whether the prediction of a new prs method was significantly better than that of the standard 1d prs defined in eq 1 for the ith crossvalidation we denote ri02 as the maximum prediction for the standard 1d prs optimized across pvalue thresholds ri12 as the maximum prediction for a new prs method optimized across all pvalue thresholds for 1d prs and all pairs of pvalue thresholds for 2d prs we defined i ri12 ri02 and estimated its variance as 2i1ki 2k1 with  i1kik we calculated the statistic t 2k and evaluated its significance using the tdistribution for the five diseases with independent validation samples we used bootstrap to estimate the variance of the r2 estimates to test significance 29
 
suppose that for a given trait of interest y there are two predefined snp sets the high priority hp snp set s1 and the low priority lp snp set s2 snps have been pruned and are in linkage equilibrium we assume that s1 has m1 independent susceptibility snps and m3 null snps while s2 has m2 susceptibility snps and m4 independent null snps following chatterjee et al 11 we assume that the true relationship between outcome y and independent susceptibility snps is modeled as follows yi1m11ig1i j1m22jg2jk1m30g3kl1m40g4l where all y and the genotypic values gs are standardized so that ey  0 vary  1 eg  zero and varg  1 and the error term   n0 2 and is independent of the genotypic values
 
from a discovery gwas data set of size n we have regression coefficient i and twosided pvalue pi for each snp we build an additive prediction model by including snps in s1 with pvalue  1 and snps in s2 with pvalue  2 y12i1m11i1i1g1i j1m22j2j2g2jk1m33k3k1g3kl1m44l4l2g4l where    i p   with i  being an indicator function
 
the predictive correlation coefficient pcc for the predictive model can be expressed as pcc12coryy12i1m11i1i1i1 j1m22j2j2j2i1m11i21i1 j1m22j22j2k1m33k23k1l1m44l24l2
 
following chatterjee et al 2014 one can verify that pcc follows a normal distribution by the central limit theorem and the strong law of large numbers therefore the expected value of pcc can be approximated as epcc12i1m11ien11ipown1i1 j1m22jen22jpown2j2i1m1n11ipown1i1j1m2n22jpown2j2m31n10m42n20 m1en1pown1f1d m2en2pown2f2dm1n1pown1f1dm2n2pown2f2dm31n10m42n20 where ene1 ne21 pow n   is power to detect a snp with effect size  at a significance level  in a gwas with size n and f1 and f2 are effectsize distributions for hp and lp susceptibility snps respectively
 
in our numerical calculations we assumed that the effect sizes of the susceptibility snps in the hp and lp sets followed the same distribution n0121n022 consistent with simulations we performed grid search to identify the pvalue thresholds 1 2 that maximizes epcc1 2 for binary disease outcomes auc can be expressed as a function of pcc 11

fine mapping at both loci used data from one hundred and fiftyseven individuals who had undergone wgs and for which the data were published or available online from the sequence read archive  six new wgs recently produced by the nih intramural sequencing center nisc were also included the latter were produced using the illumina truseq dnapcrfree protocol catfc1213001 reads were aligned to the canfam three point one reference genome  using bwa 0713 mem 86 and sorted using samtools 131 87 pcr duplicates were marked as secondary reads using picardtools 224  for those libraries that were not pcrfree gatk three point five 8889 was used to perform local realignment around putative indels events using 714278 variants published in 90 as the training set a total of 172254 illumina canine hd chip positions and 2738537 dbsnp v131 variants were utilized for base recalibration with gatk 35 snv were called perindividual in gvcf mode of haplotypecaller 91 with subsequent jointcalling across all individuals variant quality score recalibration was conducted with gatk best practices and default parameters for snv and indels separately as follows indel recalibration 714278 variants as truth and training sets with a prior of six 90 snv recalibration 172254 illumina canine hd chip variants known training true prior  12 2738537 dbsnp v131 variants known true prior  8 3627539 published variants from 92 known training prior  6 we only used genomes with a sequencing depth 10x and retained only variants with a minimum of two alleles and a minor allele frequency 5 for locus 1 6809 variants met the qc criteria while 1997 met the criteria for locus two point these variants were analyzed using gemma v0941 as a linear mixedmodel software 5455 a centered kinship matrix was estimated extracting snps from the one hundred and sixtythree wgs data using the positions of 147740 snps of the illumina canine hd snp array delly and cnvnator were used to analyze structural variants including indels inversions and duplications that were 100 bp in length 9293
 
to confirm the distribution of large alleles in the irs4 and igsf1 genes we genotyped a panel of five hundred and twelve dogs of ninetythree breeds and twentyfour wolves s6 table primer pairs were designed to target regions that included the variants of interest and two pairs were specifically designed to reveal the absencepresence of the deletion s7 table targeted regions were assayed using polymerase chain reaction pcr with amplitaq gold pcr products were purified by exosapit reaction affymetrix and then sanger sequenced using bigdye terminator v31 applied biosystems products from sequencing reactions were run on abi three thousand seven hundred and thirty dna analyzer sequence traces were analyzed using phredphrapconsed package 9496 the absencepresence of the deletion was detected after migration of the pcr products on a 1 agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide to analyze the acsl4 variant we sequenced a larger set of nine hundred and eightyfive unrelated dogs and wild canids including twentyfour geographically diverse gray wolves from north america europe and asia two coyotes and two red wolves s5 table three hundred and fifteen of these dogs were included in the dataset used for the initial gwas
 
to estimate the conservation of mutated codonsnucleotides between mammals we used both protein and gene sequences from irs4 igsf1 and acsl4 which were available on ensembl 97 we selected proteins for dog human mouse cat pig horse cow and megabat and we used sim 98 and lalnview 99 to align sequences

all studies were conducted according to the declaration of helsinki the studies were approved by the local ethical review boards and all study participants provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analyses
 
we examined three anthropometric traits related to overall adiposity bmi or body fat distribution wcadjbmi and whradjbmi 36 that were available from a large number of studies before the association analyses we calculated sexspecific residuals by adjusting for age age2 bmi for wcadjbmi and whradjbmi traits only and other necessary studyspecific covariates such as genotypederived principal components subsequently we normalized the distributions of sexspecific trait residuals using inverse normal transformation
 
physical activity was assessed and quantified in various ways in the participating studies of the metaanalysis s1 and s6 tables aiming to amass as large a sample size as possible we harmonized pa by categorizing it into a simple dichotomous variablephysically inactive vs activethat could be derived in a relatively consistent way in all participating studies and that would be consistent with previous findings on genephysical activity interactions and the relationship between activity levels and health outcomes in studies with categorical pa data individuals were defined inactive if they reported having a sedentary occupation and being sedentary during transport and leisuretime 1 h of moderate intensity leisuretime or commuting pa per week all other individuals were defined physically active previous studies in largescale individual cohorts have demonstrated that the interaction between fto or a bmiincreasing genetic risk score with physical activity is most pronounced approximately at this activity level 6 37 38 in studies with continuous pa data pa variables were standardized by defining individuals belonging to the lowest sex and ageadjusted quintile of pa levels as inactive and all other individuals as active the studyspecific coding of the dichotomous pa variable in each study is described in s6 table
 
we included fortytwo studies with genomewide data ten studies with metabochip data and eight studies with both genomewide and metabochip data if both genomewide and metabochip data were available for the same individual we only included the genomewide data s1 table studies with genomewide genotyped data used either affymetrix or illumina arrays s2 table following studyspecific quality control measures the genotype data were imputed using the hapmap phase ii reference panel s2 table studies with metabochip data used the custom illumina humancardiometabo beadchip containing 195k snps designed to support largescale followup of known associations with metabolic and cardiovascular traits 39 each study ran autosomal snp association analyses with bmi wcadjbmi and whradjbmi across their array of genetic data using the following linear regression models in men and women separately 1 active individuals only 2 inactive individuals only and 3 active and inactive individuals combined adjusting for the pa stratum in studies that included families or closely related individuals regression coefficients were estimated using a variance component model that modeled relatedness in men and women combined with sex as a covariate in addition to the sexspecific analyses the additive genetic effect for each snp and phenotype association was estimated using linear regression for studies with a casecontrol design s1 table cases and controls were analyzed separately
 
all studyspecific files for the three regression models listed above were processed through a standardized quality control protocol using the easyqc software 40 the studyspecific quality control measures included checks on file completeness range of test statistics allele frequencies trait transformation population stratification and filtering out of low quality data checks on file completeness included screening for missing alleles effect estimates allele frequencies and other missing data checks on range of test statistics included screening for invalid statistics such as pvalues 1 or 0 negative standard errors or snps with low minor allele count mac calculated as mafn where maf is the minor allele frequency and n is the sample size and where snps with mac5 in the inactive or the active group were removed the correctness of trait transformation to inverse normal was examined by plotting 2median of the standard error with the square root of the sample size population stratification was examined by calculating the study specific genomic control inflation factor gc 41 if a study had gc11 the study analyst was contacted and asked to revise the analyses by adjusting for principal components the allele frequencies in each study were examined for strand issues and miscoded alleles by plotting effect allele frequencies against the corresponding allele frequencies from the hapmap2 reference panel finally low quality data were filtered out by removing monomorphic snps imputed snps with poor imputation quality r2hat 03 in mach 42 observedexpected dosage variance 03 in bimbam 43 properinfo 04 in impute 44 and genotyped snps with a low callrate 95 or that were out of hardyweinberg equilibrium p106
 
betacoefficients and standard errors were combined by an inversevariance weighted fixed effect method implemented using the metal software 45 we performed metaanalyses for each of the three models active inactive active  inactive adjusted for pa in men only in women only and in men and women combined studyspecific gwas results were corrected for genomic control using all snps studyspecific metabochip results as well as the metaanalysis results for gwas and metabochip combined were corrected for genomic control using 4425 snps included on the metabochip for replication of associations with qtinterval a phenotype not correlated with bmi wcadjbmi or whradjbmi after pruning of snps within five hundred kb of an anthropometry replication snp we excluded snps that 1 were not available in at least half of the maximum sample size in each stratum 2 had a heterogeneity i2 75 or 3 were missing chromosomal and base position annotation in dbsnp
 
to identify snppa interactions we used the easystrata r package 46 to test for the difference in metaanalyzed betacoefficients between the active and inactive groups for the association of each snp with bmi wcadjbmi and whradjbmi easystrata tests for differences in effect estimates between the active and inactive strata by subtracting one beta from the other activeinactive and dividing by the overall standard error of the difference as follows zdiffactiveinactive seactive2seinactive22 r  seactive2 seinactive2 where r is the spearman rank correlation coefficient between active and inactive for all genomewide snps the joint significance of the snp main and snppa interaction effects was estimated using the method by aschard et al 16 which is a joint test for genetic main effects and geneenvironment interaction effects where geneenvironment interaction is calculated as the difference in effect estimates between two exposure strata accounting for two degrees of freedom
 
approximate conditional analyses were conducted using gcta version one point two four 19 in the analyses for snps identified in our metaanalyses of europeanancestry individuals only ld correlations between snps were estimated using a reference sample comprised of europeanancestry participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities aric study in the analyses for snps identified in our metaanalyses of all ancestries combined the reference sample comprised 93 of europeanancestry individuals and 6 of african ancestry participants from aric as well as 1 of chb and jpt samples from the hapmap2 panel to approximate the ancestry mixture in our all ancestry metaanalyses to test if our identified snps were independent secondary signals that fell within one mbp of a previously established signal we used the gctacojocond command to condition our lead snps on each previously established snp in the same locus
 
the replication analysis for the cdh12 locus included participants from the epicnorfolk ninactive  4755 nactive  11526 and fenland studies ninactive  1213 nactive  4817 and from the random subcohort of the epicinteract consortium ninactive  2154 nactive  6632 pa stratumspecific estimates of the association of cdh12 with bmi were assessed and metaanalyzed by fixed effects metaanalyses and the differences between the pastrata were determined as described above
 
to identify associations of the novel bmi wcadjbmi or whradjbmi loci with other complex traits in published gwas we extracted previously reported gwas associations within five hundred kb and r206 with any of the lead snps from the gwas catalog of the national human genome research institute and european bioinformatics institute 47 s14 table
 
we examined the cisassociations of the novel bmi wcadjbmi or whradjbmi loci with the expression of nearby genes from various tissues by performing a lookup in a library of 100 published expression datasets as described previously by zhang et al 48 in addition we examined cisassociations using gene expression data derived from fasting peripheral whole blood in the framingham heart study 49 n  5206 adjusting for pa age age2 sex and cohort for each novel locus we evaluated the association of all transcripts 1 mb from the lead snp to minimize the potential for false positives we only considered associations where our lead snp or its proxy r208 was either the peak snp associated with the expression of a gene transcript in the region or in strong ld r208 with the peak snp
 
we used the uncovering enrichment through simulation method to combine the genetic association data with the roadmap epigenomics project segmentation data 22 first 10000 sets of random snps were selected among hapmap2 snps with a maf 005 that matched the original input snps based on proximity to a transcription start site and the number of ld partners r208 in individuals of european ancestry in the one thousand genomes project the ld partners were combined with their original lead snps to create 10000 sets of matched random snps and their respective ld partners these sets were intersected with the 15state chromhmm data from the roadmap epigenomics project and resultant colocalizations were collapsed from total snps down to loci which were then used to calculate an empirical p value when comparing the original snps to the random sets we examined the enrichment for all loci reaching p105 for snppa interaction combined and for all loci reaching p5x108 in the paadjusted snp main effect model combined in addition we examined the variantspecific overlap with regulatory elements for each of the index snps of the novel bmi wcadjbmi and whradjbmi loci and variants in strong ld r208
 
we compared variance explained for bmi wcadjbmi and whradjbmi between the active and inactive groups using two approaches first we used a method previously reported by kutalik et al 15 and selected subsets of snps based on varying p value thresholds ranging from 5x108 to 005 from the snp main effect model adjusted for pa each subset of snps was clumped into independent regions using a physical distance criterion of 500kb and the most significant lead snp within the respective region was selected for each lead snp the explained variance was calculated as r211 n1p221n in the active and inactive groups separately where n is the sample size and p is the p value for snp main effect in active or inactive strata finally the variance explained by each subset of snps in the active and inactive strata was estimated by summing up the variance explained by the snps
 
second we applied the ld score regression tool developed by buliksullivan et al 14 to quantify the proportion of inflation due to polygenicity heritability rather than confounding cryptic relatedness or population stratification using metaanalysis summary results ld score regression leverages ld between causal and index variants to distinguish true signals by regressing metaanalysis summary results on an ld score ie the cumulative genetic variation that an index snp tags to obtain heritability estimates by pa strata we regressed our summary results from the genomewide metaanalyses of bmi wcadjbmi and whradjbmi stratified by pa status active and inactive on precalculated ld scores available in hapmap3 reference samples of up to 1061094 variants with maf1 and n10th percentile of the total sample size

we used a threestage design to evaluate genetic associations with bmi and whradjbmi in sexcombined and sexstratified samples s1 fig stage one included gwas metaanalyses in aa individuals and stage two included replication of top associations from stage one point stage three included metaanalysis of top associations from stages one and two aa studies and ea metaanalysis results in the discovery stage one of aaagc seventeen gwas of up to 42752 aa individuals 16559 men and 26193 women 41696 african americans and 1056 africans were included for the bmi analyses a total of ten gwas of up to 20384 aa individuals 4783 men and 15601 women all african americans were included for the whradjbmi analyses for variants with p  1104 in either the sexcombined or the sexstratified metaanalyses stage two replication was performed in additional aa individuals from aaagc n  10143 for bmi n  2711 for whradjbmi followed by metaanalysis with ea individuals from the giant consortium 322154 for bmi 210086 for whradjbmi variants that reached genomewide significance p  5108 were assessed for associations with bmi in two cohorts of children n  7222 all aa participants in these studies provided written informed consent for the research and approval for the study was obtained from the ethics review boards at all participating institutions detailed descriptions of each participating study and measurement and collection of height weight waist and hip circumferences are provided in s1 text s1 and s2 tables
 
genotyping in each study was performed with illumina or affymetrix genomewide snp arrays prephasing and imputation of missing genotypes in each study was performed using mach minimac 20 or shapeit2imputev2 2122 using the one thousand genomes project cosmopolitan reference panel phase i integrated release version 3 march 2012 18 the details of the array genotyping and imputation qualitycontrol procedures and sample exclusions for each study are listed in s3 table in general samples reflecting duplicates low call rates gender mismatch or population outliers were excluded variants were excluded by the following criteria call rate  095 minor allele count mac  6 hardyweinberg equilibrium hwe p  1104 imputation quality score  zero point three for minimac or  zero point four for impute or absolute allele frequency difference  zero point three compared with expected allele frequency calculated as one thousand genomes frequency of afr  zero point eight  eur  02
 
we evaluated the performance of one thousand genomes imputation using the largest study the womens health initiative whi n  8054 a total of twentyfive point one million variants with maf  01 were imputed to the one thousand genomes reference panel of these 981 88 million common variants 954 93 million low frequency variants 05  maf  5 and 725 46 million rare variants 01  maf  05 were well imputed with impute info scores  zero point three s4 table notably these frequencies are slightly lower than those obtained by imputation using one thousand genomes phase one interim reference panel in europeans 54 however 726 955 and 995 of the common low frequency and rare variants respectively from the one thousand genomes reference panel were not present in the hapmap and therefore demonstrate deeper coverage of the genome particularly for the low frequency and rare variants
 
at all stages genomewide association analyses were performed by each of the participating studies bmi was regressed on age age squared principal components and study site if needed to obtain residuals separately by sex and casecontrol status if needed whr was regressed on age age squared principal components bmi and study site to obtain residuals separately by sex and casecontrol status principal components were included to adjust for admixture proportion and population structure within each study residuals were inversenormally transformed to obtain a standard normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation of one for studies with unrelated subjects each variant was tested assuming an additive genetic model with each trait by regressing the transformed residuals on the number of copies of the variant effect allele the analyses were stratified by sex and casecontrol status if needed for studies that included related individuals family based association tests were conducted that took into consideration the genetic relationships among the individuals sex stratified casecontrol stratified and combined analyses were performed association results with extreme values absolute beta coefficient or standard error  10 primarily due to small sample sizes andor low minor allele count were excluded for metaanalysis
 
the latest summary statistics of sexcombined and sexstratified metaanalyses of bmi and whradjbmi imputed to the hapmap reference panel in ea from the genetic investigation of anthropometric traits giant consortium were obtained from  78 these association summary statistics were used to impute zscores of unobserved variants at the one thousand genomes project eur reference panel phase i integrated release version 3 using the impg program 23 in brief palindromic variants atcg and variants with allele mismatch with the reference were removed from the data using the impgsummary method the zscore of an unobserved variant was calculated as a linear combination of observed zscores weighted by the variancecovariance matrix between variants induced by ld within a one mb window from the reference haplotypes the sample size of each unobserved variant was also interpolated from the sample sizes of observed variants using the same weighting method for zscore as nit1ttwitwitnt here t  12t where t is the number of observed variants wit is the element of the covariance matrix it for the unobserved variant i and the observed variant t within window the performance of imputation was assessed by r2pred with similar characteristics as the standard imputation accuracy metric r2hat 20 results of variants with r2pred  zero point six were used in subsequent analyses
 
in the discovery stage 1 association results were combined across studies in sexcombined and sexstratified samples using inversevariance weighted fixedeffect metaanalysis implemented in the program metal 55 the studyspecific  values of association ranged from zero point nine seven to one point zero five for bmi and zero point nine eight to one point zero five for whradjbmi s3 table genomic control correction 56 was applied to each study before metaanalysis and to the overall results after metaanalysis   one point zero seven for bmi one point zero one for whradjbmi variants with results generated from  50 of the total sample size for each trait were excluded after filtering the numbers of variants reported in the metaanalyses were 17972087 for bmi and 20502658 for whradjbmi
 
variants with p  1104 in stage one sexcombined or sexstratified metaanalyses were carried forward for replication in additional aa individuals stage 2 and ea individuals stage 3 for each of the replication aa studies trait transformation and association were performed as in stage one and results were metaanalyzed using the inversevariance method in metal for the replication study in ea hapmap imputed summary statistics of each trait from the giant consortium were used to impute zscores of unobserved variants at the one thousand genomes
 
in stages one and 2 metaanalysis results of aa studies were combined using the inversevariance weighted method in all stages including both aa and ea studies metaanalysis results expressed as signed zscores were combined using the fixed effect sample size weighted method in metal due to the lack of beta and standard error estimates from the impg program 23 evidence of heterogeneity of allelic effects between males and females within and across stages were assessed by the i2 statistic in metal genomewide significance was declared at p  5108 from each of the sexcombined and sexstratified metaanalysis including aa andor combined aa and ea individuals difference in effects between men and women was assessed using cochrans q test and nominal phet  zero point zero five declared as significant a lead variant in a locus was defined as the most significant variant within a one mb region a novel locus was defined as a lead variant with distance  five hundred kb from any established lead variants reported in previous studies by convention a locus was named by the closest genes to the lead variant
 
for the genomewide significant loci identified in sexcombined and sexstratified analyses in aa stages 12 we used the program gcta 5758 to select the top independent associated variants from summary statistics of the metaanalyses this method uses the ld correlations between variants estimated from a reference sample to perform an approximate conditional association analysis we used 8054 unrelated individuals of african ancestry from the whi cohort with 157m variants available as the reference sample for ld estimation to select the top independent variants in the discovery and replication metaanalysis results we first selected all variants that had p  5108 and conducted analysis conditioning on the selected variants to search for the top variants iteratively via a stepwise model to select the independent variants from this list then we proceeded to condition the rest of the variants that had p  5108 on the list of independent variants in the same fashion until no variant had conditional p that passed the significance level p  5108 finally all the selected variants were fitted jointly in the model for effect size estimation
 
we also tested if the genomewide significant variants identified from sexcombined gwas in aa and the locuswide significant variants identified from sexcombined and sexspecific locus transferability studies in aa were independent from nearby established loci identified from ea studies 78 first the published lead variants from ea studies were used to search for all surrogate variants that were in high ld r208 in one thousand genomes project eur population second these variants were pruned to select only variants in low ld in aa r203 in the one thousand genomes project afr population to avoid collinearity in conditional analysis third association analysis was conducted on the aa significant variants conditioned on the selected ea lead and surrogate variants using the program gcta and estimated ld correlation from the whi cohort for genomewide significant loci an aa derived association signal is considered as independent from the established ea signals when the difference inlogp 3 and difference in effect size  one standard error after conditional analysis for locuswide significant loci given the lower level of significance independence is only considered as difference in effect size  one standard error after conditional analysis
 
we investigated the transferability of ea bmi and whr associated variants and loci in aa individuals from stage one sexcombined and sexstratified metaanalyses first we tested for replication of lead variants previously reported to be associated with bmi 176 variants from one hundred and seventy loci and whradjbmi 84 variants from sixtyfive loci at genomewide significance in sexcombined and sexstratified analyses from the giant consortium studies 79 we defined snp transferability as an ea lead variant sharing the same traitraising allele at nominal p  zero point zero five in aa individuals to account for differences in local ld structure across populations we also interrogated the flanking 01cm regions of the lead variants to search for the best variants with the smallest association p in aa individuals locuswide significance was declared as plocus  zero point zero five by bonferroni correction for the effective number of tests within a locus estimated using the li and ji approach 59
 
we compared the credible set intervals of established loci that showed locuswide significance plocus  005 in the sexcombined or sexspecific analyses from this study in summary statistics datasets including the one thousand genomes imputed results from giant aaagc and metaanalysis of giant and aaagc in each dataset a candidate region is defined as the flanking 01cm region of the lead variant reported by the giant consortium under the assumption of one causal variant in a region of m variants the posterior probability of a variant j with association statistics z driving the association pcjz was calculated using the formula pcjzexp12zj2j1mexp12zj2 a 99 credible set was constructed by ranking all variants by their posterior probability followed by adding variants until the credible set has a cumulative posterior probability  zero point nine nine 53
 
to determine whether any of our nine novel gwas lead variants identified in the sexcombined and sexspecific analyses might be tagging potentially functional variants we identified all variants within one mb and in ld r2  07 one thousand genomes afr with our lead variants as such we identified one hundred and thirtyseven variants and annotated each of them using annovar 60 the predicted functional impact for coding variants were assessed via the exome variant server  for phastcon gerp 61 and polyphen 62 as well as sift 63
 
we further characterized the variants that were in ld with the novel variants using the webbased tool regulomedb  24 the variants that were likely to affect binding and linked to expression of a gene target scores 1a1f based on eqtl transcription factor tf binding matched tf motif matched dnase footprint and dnase peak or were only likely to affect binding scores 2a2c based on tf binding matched tf motif matched dnase footprint and dnase peak were selected for these variants the sequence conservation gerp and siphy 64 the epigenomic data from the roadmap epigenomic project chromhmm states corresponding to enhancer or promoter elements histone modification chipseq peaks and dnase hypersensitivity data peaks the regulatory protein binding from the encode project the regulatory motifs based on commercial literature and motiffinding analysis of the encode project and the eqtls from genotypetissue expression gtex project 65 were extract from webbased haploreg v4 25 for variants within the tractable credible sets in the fine mapping analyses similar analyses were also conducted
 
to assess whether the novel loci identified in the sexcombined and sexspecific analyses were associated with any related cardiometabolic and anthropometric traits or may be in high ld with known eqtls we examined the nhgriebi gwas catalog 27 and the grasp genomewide repository of associations between snps and phenotypes catalog 28 for reported varianttrait associations near our lead variants we supplemented the catalogs with additional genomewide significant associations of interest from the literature 7966 we used plink to identify variants within one mb of lead variants all variants within the specified regions with r2  zero point seven 1000 genomes afr were retained from the catalogs for further evaluation
 
given our sample sizes in the discovery and replication stages in our african ancestry populations we have 80 power to detect variants explaining 008 variance for bmi that corresponds to effect sizes of zero point zero nine and zero point two zero sd units for maf of zero point zero five and 001 respectively for whradjbmi we have 80 power to detect variants explaining 018 variance that corresponds to effect sizes of zero point one four and zero point three zero sd units for maf of zero point zero five and 001 respectively

the sol illumina omni 25m array contains five variants rs2362744 rs4021971 rs4021965 rs11639532 rs2858942 within the 3811bp alphaglobin structural variant that can be used for determining copy number raw probe intensity data normalized x and y values were exported from genomestudio as finalreport files and then imported into the genvisis software package  last accessed jan 2017 in order to use its specialized cnv calling algorithm the first step in the process is to recompute the log r ratios lrrs using centroids derived from only highquality samples standard deviation of the autosomal lrrs 032 and genotype call rate 98 lrrs from a set of 50000 curated markers were included in a principal components analysis pca to capture dna quality dna quantity and batch effects after regressing out sixty pcs from the raw intensity data we recomputed lrrs and determined the median lrr value for the five markers in the alphaglobin region copynumber 0 1 2 3 or 4 calling for the structural variant was then performed after visual inspection of the cluster boundaries with median lrr on the xaxis and median absolute difference on the yaxis for rbc phenotype association analyses genotypes were then coded and analyzed separately for the presence of the 38kb alphaglobin deletion 0 1 or two copies and the presence of the 38kb alphaglobin duplication 0 1 or two copies
 
for replication of discovery associations in hchssol one thousand genomes project phase 1imputed gwas data were utilized from three hispaniclatino study populations these included the womens health initiative whi snp health association resource share project n  3454 the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa cohort n  782 and mount sinai biome biobank n  285456 genotyping in whishare and mesa was performed using affymetrix six point zero array and imputation was performed with mach software57 biome was genotyped using the illumina omniexpressexome beadchip array phasing was performed using shapeit version two release six hundred and fortyfour and imputation with impute version two point three using the all one thousand genomes project phase one integrated variant set aug 2012 as the reference
 
all outcomes were analyzed using linear mixedeffect models lmms with random effects accounting for interindividual correlation due to either relatedness shared household or census block group the covariates fixed effects included age sex five principal components recruitment center current cigarette smoking sampling weight and genetic analysis group cuban dominican puerto rican mexican central american and south american54 when performing analysis on the x chromosome we included the first two x chromosomespecific principal components as covariates additionally pairwise genetic relatedness as estimated from the x chromosome was included as a random effect along with the autosomal genetic relatedness matrix additionally since males have only one copy of x chromosome genotypes on the x chromosome were coded 0 1 two for females and 0 two for males we also conducted three additional analyses for the known g6pd locus on the x chromosome 1 sexstratified analysis s10 table 2 genotypespecific analysis in women since there is evidence for skewed x chromosomeinactivation with age58 s11 table and 3 agegenotype interaction analysis s12 table
 
more information about the principal components kinship matrix computation and the genetic analysis groups is provided in conomos et al54 potential inflation was assessed using quantilequantile plots of the test statistics against the standard normal distribution and a calculated inflation factor gc we report genomewide significant results at significance threshold of pvalue 50x108 and suggestive significance threshold of pvalue 10x107 in the hchssol discovery sample for all variants with maf  zero point zero one and imputation oevar 03 all snps exceeding genomewide significance threshold of pvalue 1x107 are described in s9 table
 
local ancestry estimates were previously inferred in the hchssol59 a genomewide admixture mapping scan was performed using a linear mixed model with covariates and random effects described above jointly testing the three ancestries european african amerindian at each available locus on the basis of previous simulation results a nominal pvalue of 57x105 yielded a genomewide type i error of 005 there are currently no welldeveloped validated methods available for local ancestry estimation on the x chromosome hence we performed admixture mapping analysis only on the autosomes
 
association testing was performed in each of the three hispanic replication data sets whi biome mesa using linear regression and the same rbc trait transformation as the discovery samples adjusted for age sex and principal components metaanalysis of results from the three independent hispanic replication study samples was performed using the inversevarianceweighted method implemented in metal  last accessed dec 2016 we defined novel replicated loci as those which exceeded a bonferronicorrected significance threshold of p 0057 or zero point zero zero seven one accounting for seven snps carried forward for replication and are located 1 megabase mb from a previously reported genomewide significant association signal
 
we performed stepwise conditional analysis for each rbc phenotype to identify secondary independent association signals within 500kb of known and newly discovered gwas loci in the first round of the conditional analysis for each trait we used the same regression model as in the discovery gwas with additional adjustment for previously reported or novel variants identified in this study the list of variants used in conditional analysis of each trait is provided in s13 table the significance threshold for discovering new independent association signals was the same as the genomewide discovery threshold   50x108 as well as maf001 subsequent rounds of conditional analysis were repeated for each genomic region adding the strongest genomewide significant variant from the previous round as a covariate in the regression model until no further genomewide significant variants satisfying the maf threshold remained in that region after covariate adjustment the full models for each trait used in the final round of conditional analysis are listed in s14 table after obtaining probe intensitybased cnv calls for the 38kb alphaglobin cnv we conducted conditional analysis on chromosome sixteen using the calls from the retyped cnv the full models for each trait used in these conditional analysis are also listed in s14 table conditional analysis with the retyped 38kb alphaglobin cnv was conducted on the subset of 12390 individuals for whom the retyped cnv calls were available
 
variants used in generalization analyses were identified by one of two inclusion methods 1 any variant listed as genomewide significant for any of the seven rbc traits in our study in the european bioinformatics institute gwas catalog  last accessed jan 2017 or 2 any rbc trait genomewidesignificant variants published in the main text or supplement of an englishlanguage gwas indexed in pubmed prior to december two thousand and sixteen point of note we did not identify any gwas published in a language other than english hence we expect our list of variants identified using these methods to be complete prior to 2017 we tested each published rbcassociated variant to see whether that association generalized to hispanicslatinos the directional generalization null hypothesis is rejected if there is enough evidence that the published variant is directionally consistent and associated with the outcome in both the discovery study and hchssol we evaluated for generalization all available signals previously reported in any gwas published in english for all seven traits evaluated in this paper s4 table most of these snps were reported in studies of adults of european ancestry but we also generalized associations from african and japaneseancestry populations no variants identified in danjou 2015 were included in our genotyped or imputed dataset and hence these variants could not be evaluated for generalization60 to test the generalization null hypotheses we computed directional fdr rvalues for each of the tested snps directional rvalues were calculated based on onesided pvalues from both the discovery study reported in the literature and the hchssol and based on the number of tests performed in the discovery study in order to properly account for multiple testing a snp was considered generalized if its rvalue was 00561 in generalizing associations reported by ganesh et al 2009 we did not employ directional control since ganesh et al 2009 did not report effect sizes or directions8 the implication is a slight loss of power
 
generalization analysis was performed by looking up reported snps in hchssol results in an analysis that mimics the analysis reported in the discovery study for example if a trait was reported as an association analysis with the naturallogtransformed trait we performed the analysis with the same transformation in the hchssol population in some cases as with kamatani et al 2010 we also matched effectsize reporting methods standard deviations for ease of comparison transformations when applicable are described in s1 table since the same snptrait association may be reported by multiple studies we counted only unique snptrait associations in instances where more than one study reported associations for the same snps and trait but used different trait transformations we selected the results from the generalization analysis in which the trait transformation matched our primary analysis
 
since some snps are associated with more than one rbc trait and some genomic regions contain multiple snps associated with multiple traits we summarize the generalization results as follows overall we summarize the number of generalized unique traitsnp associations the same snp may be counted more than once if associated with more than one trait then for each trait we summarized 1 the number of unique snps and 2 the number of unique genomic regions to define genomic regions we identified specific snps and a 1mb genomic region around them other snps within these regions were clumped together we say that a genomic region generalized for a specific trait if at least one snp in the region was associated with the trait
 
we assessed any novel replicated red blood cell associated loci to determine potentially causal variants at each locus we determined if the lead or proxy variants r2  08 were located within putative erythroid regulatory elements defined on the basis of enrichment for various histonemodification and chipseq signals in either erythroblasts or the erythroleukemia cell line k5623436 we defined these regulatory regions as follows enrichment for histone h3k4me1 as an enhancer enrichment for histone h3k4me3 as a promoter variants located within a putative promoter or enhancer and that overlapped a dnasei hypersensitive site in proerythroblasts or k562 cells were prioritized as putatively functional 34 36 62 regulatory elements often are bound by transcription factors and hence we report chipseq peak overlaps of key erythroid transcription factors gata1 tal1 and others in proerythroblasts and k562 cells to provide further support for the functional role of putative regulatory elements in erythroid cells34 36 62 the encode and blueprint datasets were accessed through the encode analysis hub and blueprint hub respectively via the ucsc genome browser63 64 datasets from xu et al were accessed from codex  last accessed dec 201662 65 to hypothesize likely mode of action via which the causal variants influence the trait we report eqtl targets and or motifs disrupted by prioritized variants using haploreg v4166 all the datasets used for functional annotation were mapped to human grch37hg19 assembly functional annotation is summarized in s5 table we also used in silico prediction algorithms to annotate variants these included regulomedb the combined annotation dependent depletion cadd phred score gwava and deltasvm6770 these annotations are summarized in s6 table

individualdata to validate the association between mapuche ancestry and gallbladder cancer was analyzed by univariate cox regression gallbladdercancerfree survival was defined as the time interval between birth and diagnosis with gallbladder cancer unaffected subjects at the time of interview were considered censored gender educational level region and individual mapuche proportion were taken into account as explanatory variables using the categories listed in table four point
 
in order to examine the robustness of regional ancestry estimates against possible outliers subjects were excluded one by one and the corresponding estimated regional ancestry proportions were visually inspected
 
the impact of the differential number of individuals per region eg de arica y parinacota n  794 de magallanes y de la antartica chilena n  5 on the estimated standardized mortality ratios for gallbladder cancer was evaluated by resampling regional ancestry estimates were assumed to be normally distributed with means equal to the expected regional ancestry proportions and variances proportional to the corresponding standard errors after drawing 50000 samples from the corresponding normal distributions standardized mortality rates were estimated and summarized by the median 25th and 975th percentiles
 
estimated native american proportions were relatively low for some mapuche reference individuals minimum 74 in order to investigate the sensitivity of results to these low proportions we filtered out variants of likely european descent in mapuche reference individuals and reran statistical analyses in detail we calculated 80 confidence intervals cis of the minor allele frequency in european hgdp and mapuche reference individuals variants with overlapping 80 cis in european and hgdp reference groups and with overlapping 80 cis in european and mapuche reference individuals were excluded from subsequent sensitivity analyses this filtering resulted in more than eighteen thousand selected variants after ld pruning which artificially increased the native american proportion of mapuche reference individuals to 98 at least
 
in order to disentangle possible mortalityancestry associations attributable to collinearity among the ancestry componentsthe sum of african european mapuche and aymara proportions equals 100we conducted a stepwise forward model selection to identify the most significantly associated ancestry components the significance level for entry and for staying in the model was set to 01 model selection results were visualized in a venn diagram
 
to apportion the relative contributions of mapuche ancestry and access to the chilean health system 2002standardized hospitalization rates due to gallbladder removal were included into the multiple poisson regression model as additional explanatory variable 10 cholecystectomies per one hundred and five personyears and standardized mortality ratios per 1 increase in ancestry proportions were reestimated
 
the inclusion of families in the validation study originated a dependency among observed variablesfor example estimated ancestry proportions tend to be similar within families and consideration of actual incidence rates of gallbladder cancer may improve the accuracy of cancerfree survival estimates the mendel software was used to take into account family relationships and real incidence rates of gallbladder cancer in chile in validation analyses 43 44

each study followed protocols for phenotype harmonization for individuals taking antihypertensive medications we added fifteen and ten mm hg to measured sbp and dbp respectively a standard method used in other bp gwas6 68 pp was calculated as the difference between sbp and dbp after addition of the constant values htn was defined by a sbp  one hundred and forty mm hg a dbp  ninety mm hg or use of antihypertensive drugs69
 
each cohort was genotyped on either affymetrix or illumina genotyping platforms preimputation quality criteria were applied as described in s2 table and included exclusion of individuals with discordant selfreported gender and genetic gender imputation was performed using the software machadmix machminimac or impute2 7072 using the phase one integrated march two thousand and twelve release multiethnic reference panel from the 1000g consortium 
 
autosomal chromosome snp associations for sbp dbp and pp were assessed by linear regression for unrelated data or by the generalized linear mixedeffects model for family data under the assumption of an additive genetic model all models were adjusted for age age2 sex and body mass index up to ten principal components were included as needed as covariates in the regression models to control population stratification74 75 we used standardized premetaanalysis qc criteria for all twentyone discovery studies76 at the snp level we excluded variants with 1 imputation quality r2  zero point three in mach or 04 in impute2 2 the number of informative individuals 2mafnr2  30 3 an effect allele frequency eaf difference larger than zero point three in comparison with the mixture of 80 yri and 20 ceu of 1000g and 4 the absolute regression coefficient  ten point snps that passed the qc were carried forward for inverse variance weighted metaanalyses implemented in metal77
 
we applied the cpassoc software to combine association evidence of sbp dbp and htn cpassoc provides two statistics shom and shet as previously described39 shom is similar to the fixed effect metaanalysis method77 but accounts for the correlation of summary statistics of the multitraits and for overlapping or related samples among the cohorts shom uses the trait sample size as the weight so that it is possible to combine traits with different measurement scales shet is an extension of shom and it can increase the statistical power over shom when a variant affects only a subset of traits the distribution of shet under the null hypothesis was obtained through an estimated beta distribution to calculate the statistics shom and shet and to account for the correlation among the traits a correlation matrix is required in this study we used the correlation matrix calculated from the residuals of the three bp traits after adjustments for covariates and principal components
 
all independent snps identified with p  106 threshold chosen for suggestive association in the discovery stage were carried forward for replication in africanancestry individuals and in multiethnic samples of european americans east asians or hispanicslatinos fig 1 for singletrait analyses we conducted fixed effect metaanalyses in the replication sets for each of four bp traits sbp dbp pp and htn followed by a combined transethnic metaanalysis of each trait this was followed by a megametaanalyses combining the results of discovery and replication for single traits using fixedeffects metaanalysis we also performed a multitrait cpassoc analysis of sbp dbp and htn in each replication study because cpassoc only generated test statistics shomshet and corresponding p values without effect sizes we combined the association p values from all four replication populations using fishers method  finally we combined the cpassoc metaanalysis results from the discovery and replication stages using fishers method
 
for a single trait gwas discovery analysis we used genomewide significant level p  50108 we performed six different analyses four single trait sbp dbp pp and htn analyses and two cpassoc shom and shet analyses for each snp for the four single correlated traits sbp dbp pp and htn we calculated the number of independent traits using the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix 78 which resulted two independent traits therefore we counted four independent analyses which were two independent single traits and two statistics of cpassoc analyses and applied an experimental significance level p  125108 for claiming a genomewide significance when combining discovery and replication samples we should point out that the two cpassoc test statistics and a single trait statistic are not independent thus the significance level p  125108 is conservative
 
since a locus may consist of multiple independent signals we applied approximate conditional analysis implemented in gctacojo79 80 using the summary statistics of snps with p  10106 from both of the individual trait metaanalyses  the ld among variants was estimated from the five african american cohorts from the care consortium79
 
pathway analysis was performed using the metaanalysis geneset enrichment of variant associations magenta program  using the summary statistics from the four bp traits and two statistics from cpassoc from the discovery stage we tested whether sets of functionallyrelated genes are enriched for associations this method first converts the p values of snps into gene scores with correcting for confounders such as gene site number of variants in a gene and their ld patterns and then calculated a gene set enrichment p value for each biological pathway or gene set of interest using a nonparametric statistical test the nominal gsea p value refers to the nominal gene set enrichment p value for a gene set the database of pathwaygenesets to be tested include ingenuity june 2008 kegg 2010 go and the panther signaling pathways downloaded from msigdb and panther   we applied the parameters suggested by the authors which includes the 75th percentile cut off of gene scores the nominal gsea pvalue  zero point zero one and the false discovery rate fdr  03
 
the enrichment of heritability of genomic regions to different functional categories including cell typespecific elements was evaluated using the method of ld score regression  82 this method partitioned the heritability from the discovery gwas summary statistics of four bp traits sbp dbp pp and htn while accounting for ld among markers42 we calculated enrichment in functional regions and in expanded regions 500bp around each functional class based on functional annotation using a full baseline model previously created from twentyfour publicly available main annotations that are not specific to any cell type42 enrichment was calculated based on the ratio of explained heritability and the proportion of snps in each annotation category the standard error of enrichment was estimated with a block jackknife to calculate z scores and p values42 the multiple testing threshold was determined using the bonferroni correction while accounting for two independenttrait analyses based on ji and lis method78 p of 00525 classes  two traits we also performed celltypespecific group enrichment analysis using celltypespecific annotations from four histone marks h3k4me1 h3k4me3 h3k9ac and h3k27ac which corresponded to two hundred and twenty cell types we divided the two hundred and twenty celltypespecific annotations into ten groups adrenalpancreas central nervous system cns cardiovascular connectivebone gastrointestinal immunehematopoietic kidney liver skeletal muscle and other the analysis characterized celltypespecific annotations within each group and calculated the enrichment of heritability for each group42
 
we selected sets of variants in ld r2  zero point one from the eleven replicated variants and calculated bayes factors and posterior causal probabilities for each variant from the effect sizes and standard errors as previously described83 each distinct variant associated with multiple traits was included in the analysis only once the genomic annotations of dhs sites for three hundred and fortyeight cell types from the encode project were obtained and grouped into cell types associated with thirtyfour tissues  four genebased annotationscoding exon 5utr 3utr and 1kb upstream of transcription start site tssfrom gencode transcripts were also obtained variants overlapping each of these annotations were then identified using the variant annotations and fgwas  we tested for enrichment of variants across all signals in thirtyeight dhs categories including in the four genebased annotations in each model43
 
we used the gtex pilot database 82  to identify eqtls in the successfully replicated snps
 
to evaluate population differentiation and natural selection using haplotter40 we calculated the integrated haplotype score ihs in five cohorts of care so that we could measure the amount of extended haplotype homozygosity  hence we tested the evidence of recent positive selection at five significant snps with differences in allele frequency across continentalancestry populations the measures were standardized mean 0 variance 1 empirically to the distribution of observed ihs scores over a range of snps with similar derived allele frequencies this method assesses the evidence for selection by comparing the extended homozygosity for haplotypes on a high frequency derived allele relative to the ancestry background40

a logistic regression model was used to test the association of genetic variants with ss susceptibility in plink v107 91 the additive genetic model was calculated for variants within and 50kb flanking the seventythree differentially expressed transcripts while adjusting for gender and the first three pcs as determined by the scree test to evaluate the loading of each pc for the amount of variance explained 104 metaanalysis of rs10774671 between the initial genetic association analysis dataset 1 and the replication study dataset 2 were calculated using a zscore weighted by the sample size of each dataset in metal 105 we tested our logistic regression model for deviation from additivity using plink in both the discovery dataset and replication dataset and neither model shows significant deviation p  zero point four zero and p  031 respectively logistic regression adjusting for the most significant variants conditional analysis was performed to determine independence of the association ld and probable haplotypes were determined using haploview 106
 
quantitative levels of the differentially expressed transcripts from the microarray analysis were used as phenotypic traits in one hundred and seventyeight european subjects described above variants showing nominal association with ss passoc005 in the genetic association analysis were selected to test for ciseqtls defined by varianttranscript pairs within 50kb of the target genes or transeqtls for variants at least 1mb away association of genotype with transcript expression was evaluated using both linear regression adjusted for gender and disease status and analysis of variance anova in matrixeqtl 107 fdradjusted p values were calculated to determine the significance of the eqtl the results of the ciseqtl analyses were plotted in prism six point we also used a tool peer based on a bayesian framework to adjust for unknown nongenetic factors in gene expression 108 we transformed our expression values using all the genes that passed qc by running peer for fifteen factors we then used the peer residuals from the fortyfour ssassociated passoc005 ifn signature genes as quantitative traits to determine eqtl while adjusting for other known potentially confounding factors sex disease status antirossa status and age
 
in addition to additive genetic models we also performed eqtl analyses using linear regression by three other models recessive recode genotype from 012 where two equals to aa to 001 dominant 011 and overdominant 010 we used the coefficient of determination r2 to evaluate the goodnessoffit in each of these models as shown in s4 table both the p42 and p48 isoforms fit the additive model best highest r2 whereas the recessive model outperformed in the p46 isoform regression r2rec  zero point five seven vs r2add  054 however the difference of the r2 between the dominant and additive models in the p46 eqtl analysis is subtle also the outperformance of the recessive model cannot be confirmed by qpcr where the additive model has the highest r2 therefore we only reported the additive results in the main text however the alternative genetic models for the eqtl effect observed in different isoforms may reflect distinct disease mechanisms rendered by these isoforms and thus detailed contribution of different isoforms on disease susceptibility warrant further functional study
 
the colocalization analysis between genetic association and ciseqtl results in the oas1 region was performed using ecaviar 53 we used the zscores calculated by standard error and the ld matrix calculated using plinkr from both the genetic association and ciseqtl results as input and assumed one causal variant to obtain colocalization posterior probability clpp scores for all the tested four hundred and fiftythree variants in the oas1 region
 
peripheral blood mrna transcripts from twentyseven antirossa positive ss cases thirtythree antirossa negative ss cases and thirty healthy controls were isolated and measured as described above rnaseq was performed using the illumina hiseq two thousand employing standard procedures multiplexing of six samples per lane was utilized post sequence data were processed with illumina pipeline software v17 quality of raw sequence data was assessed using fastqc we assessed the quality of each sample using aqm 92 as described above a total of six samples were removed from analysis due to significantly different expression patterns revealed by pc analysis raw fastq files were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using tophat 57 that aligns the reads across splicing junctions independent of gene annotations which benefits de novo detection of alternative splicing events the total gene transcript level was determined by normalized read counts raw read counts divided by estimated size factor in deseq 109
 
to determine alternative splicing events the referenceindependent construction of the transcripts was performed using cufflinks 58 to identify transcripts 1 of the most abundant isoform in each sample we only kept the transcripts that were detected in more than 10 of the samples for further analysis the previously annotated isoforms p46 p42 and p48 and an unannotated isoform identified across multiple samples p44 were used as reference to reconstruct the isoforms of oas1 the novel identified isoforms of oas1 were also checked manually in the integrative genomics viewer igv 110 to confirm the transcripts and crossexon reads the fpkm values calculated by cufflinks were used to determine the expression levels of each isoform of oas1

after a six week stratification in moist long fiber sphagnum moss luster leaf products inc usa at four c setaria seeds were planted in four inch diameter 10 cm white pots prefilled with 470 cm3 of metromix three hundred and sixty soil hummert usa and zero point five g of osmocote classic 141414 fertilizer everris usa after planting seeds were given seven days to germinate in a conviron growth chamber with long day photoperiod 16 h day8 h night light intensity two hundred and thirty molm2s at 31c day21c night before being loaded onto the bellweather phenotyping system using a random block design plants were grown on the system for twentyfive days under long day photoperiod 16 h day8 h night light intensity five hundred molm2s cycling the temperature to match the photoperiod 31c day21c night and maintaining the relative humidity between 4080 weighing and watering of plants was performed between 23 times per day to maintain soil volumetric water content at either 40 fullcapacity fc drought or 100 fc wellwatered as determined by 52 water limitation began fifteen days after planting individual plants were imaged at four different angular rotations 0 90 180 270 every other day
 
the effect of pot size was evaluated by growing parental lines of setaria viridis a10 and setaria italica b100 in four different size pots one hundred and sixty cm3 to plastics 715348c four hundred and seventythree cm3 poppelmann vcc ten f us nine hundred and fifty cm3 stuewe  sons mt38 and six thousand and thirtythree cm3 nursery supplies c600 filled with metromix three hundred and sixty soil sun gro horticulture seeds were given seven days to germinate in a greenhouse and watered daily by the donald danforth plant science center greenhouse staff plants were grown for fifty days under long day photoperiod 14 h day ten h night cycling the temperature to match photoperiod 27c day 23c night and maintaining the relative humidity between 40100
 
in the field plant height was measured as the distance from the plant base to the uppermost leaf collar on the culm in two thousand and thirteen this was measured by judging the average height of the canopy in a subplot relative to a yard stick and recorded the measurement using a janam xp20 hand held scanner janam technologies woodbury ny in two thousand and fourteen height was directly measured repeatedly on three tagged plants in each subplot in each field experiment a direct culm height measurement was taken at the final destructive biomass harvest in two thousand and thirteen this was done on three representative plants from each subplot in two thousand and fourteen this was done on the sametagged plants as the infield repeated height measurements
 
in the two thousand and thirteen density experiment height was measured at 19 25 31 38 45 52 59 and sixtyseven days after seed sowing final biomass harvest began eightyseven days after seed sowing in the two thousand and thirteen drought experiment height was measured at 21 29 36 43 50 59 and sixtyseven days after seed sowing final biomass harvest began ninetytwo days after seed sowing in the two thousand and fourteen drought experiment height was measured at 25 33 40 and fortyseven days after seed sowing final biomass harvest began fiftynine days after seed sowing in the two thousand and fourteen density experiment height was measured at twentyfive and fortysix days after seed sowing final biomass harvest began sixtyseven days after seed sowing
 
panicle emergence was measured as the number of days after sowing at which the panicle head was seen past the collar of the culm flag leaf in at least half of the individuals in a genotype specific subplot
 
at carnegie plant height was measured from the base of the plant to the tip of the panicle at fortyeight days after seed sowing
 
five different measurement functions encoded within the plantcv software package were used to estimate plant height in the images collected at the bellweather phenotyping facility 52 s1 fig these include length of the plant object along the yaxis extenty length of the plant object from the top of the pot to the maximal yaxis point identified as the plant object heightabovebound the distance from the top of the pot to the ycoordinate reported as the center of mass of the plant object centroidy the distance from the top of the pot to the ycoordinate identified as the center of the ellipse that encompasses the plant object ellipsey and an additional function designed to estimate the distance between the top of the pot and ycoordinate where average plant width is maximized canopyheight canopy height is calculated by dividing the heightabovebound measure into twenty different equally sized scoring windows divide the object into 5 intervals along the yaxis scoring is based upon median width within each interval and measuring the median plant width within each window the function reports the average of ycoordinates that comprises the scoring window and median width within the scoring window where the object plant is the widest canopywidth
 
centroidy and ellipsecentery were the most and least heritable measurements of plant height respectively s2a fig and s2 table heightabovebound and extenty exhibited the largest proportion of variance attributed to water limitation s2b fig and s3 table summarization of height measurements derived from four rotational side view images was performed by calculating the mean median maximum or minimum of each distribution summarization method does not appear to influence the heritability of this these traits s3 fig all height metrics are reported as the average value estimated from all individual rotational images at each plant time point lengths of objects measured in pixels were converted to centimeters cm using the calibration reported by 52
 
plant height of parental lines grown in the greenhouse at the donald danforth plant science center were measured as the distance from the base of the plant to most distant leaf collar on the culm using a tape measure measurements were recorded every other day during the workweek for a span of fifty days
 
a de novo genetic map of the a10 x b100 setaria ril population was constructed through genotyping by sequencing gbs using the methods described in 5455 briefly leaf tissue was collected from plants in the two thousand and fourteen planting density experiment in addition to greenhouse trials high molecular weight dna was extracted using the ctab method 56 and quantified using a nanodrop one thousand spectrophotometer thermo scientific waltham ma dna was then doubledigested using the restriction enzymes pst1 and mspi and a unique barcode and common adaptors were ligated onto their respective fragment ends 57 after size selection and cleanup using agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter brea ca barcoded samples were pooled and submitted for sequencing 100bp single end reads using two illumina hiseq lanes illumina san diego ca
 
the resulting sequence reads were processed using the tassel three point zero gbs pipeline 58 raw sequence reads were filtered to remove any tags that were not present twenty times at minimum within in each lane of sequencing and anchored to the s viridis genome version one point one phytozome using bowtie2 59 with default parameters anchored snp polymorphisms exhibiting an inbreeding coefficient less than zero point nine were removed and identical taxa within and between library preps 2 sequencing lanes were called as heterozygous if the ratio between alleles in and between all identical taxa andor library preps was less than 08 all polymorphisms categorized as heterozygous were called as missing values for the remainder of the analysis yielding 17612 snps
 
the genetic map was generated using the rqtl software 60 genotype calls within the combined a10 taxa were compared to the s viridis reference genome version one point one phytozome and all missing and noncongruent polymorphisms were removed the remaining sites were filtered to remove snps not present in  90 of the unified taxa yielding two hundred and seventeen rils and 3295 markers all polymorphisms were then recoded to reflect their parent of origin dubious genotype calls were identified by examining the recombination frequency between adjacent markers based upon manual inspection of histograms generated of recombination fraction between adjacent markers all markers exhibiting a recombination frequency between adjacent markers greater than 36 80 recombinations  two hundred and seventeen individuals were considered to be erroneous and removed from the map next imputation of missing genotypes was performed at all sites that did not exhibit recombination between missing makers using the rqtl fillgeno function and specifying the nodblxo method and duplicate markers were removed from the genetic map finally the genetic distance between markers was calculated using the kosambi mapping function assuming a genotype error rate of 0005 prior to qtl mapping individuals missing more than 10 of their genotype calls are removed yielding a genetic map containing two hundred and eight individuals genotyped at 1595 sites with 996 coverage based on pairwise similarity between identical individuals the gbs map constructed here is highly consistent with other genetic maps of this population described in the literature 4961
 
variance components corresponding to broad sense heritability and total variance explained were estimated using a mixed linear model using the r package lme4 62 broad sense heritability was calculated using two methods within an individual experiment broad sense heritability on a lineestimate basis was calculated using the following formula h2experiment2genotype 2genotype  2genotype x treatment ntreatment  2residual nreplicates in which ntreatment is the harmonic mean of the number of treatment blocks in which each line was observed and nreplicates is the harmonic mean of number of replicates of each genotype in the experiment heritability within treatment blocks was calculated by fitting a linear model with genotype as the only explanatory factor within each treatment block
 
the proportion of variance attributed to genotype divided by total variance within each treatment block is reported as broad sense heritability within treatment
 
total variance explained was calculated by fitting a linear model including factors genotype treatment plot and genotype x treatment effects across all phenotypic values in all treatments the proportion of variance that is incorporated into these factors divided by the total variance in the experiment is reported as total variance explained
 
best linear unbiased predictors blups of plant height for each genotype were predicted from a linear mixed effect model independently within all individual time points of field drought and density experiments in two thousand and thirteen and two thousand and fourteen using lme4 62 the following terms were included in the model yijk genotypei treatmentj plottreatmentkj genotype x treatmentijijk in which yijk is the individual observation of plant height  is the overall mean genotypei is the effect of the ith genotype treatmentj is the effect of the jth treatment plottreatmentkj is the effect of the kth plot nested within the jth treatment and genotype x treatmentij is a term describing the interaction between the ith genotype and jth treatment and ijk is the random error term as fixed effects we entered treatment and plot nested within treatment into the model the terms genotype and genotype by treatment interactions were modeled as random effects
 
logistic regression was used to model the line values of plant height in experiments performed at the bellweather phenotyping facility three types of logistic regression models considered threeparameter logistic fourparameter logistic and gompertz and estimates from the model with the lowest akaike information criterion aic score were used modeling was performed using r functions described in 63
 
qtl mapping was performed at each time point within treatment blocks and on the numerical difference relative difference and trait ratio calculated between treatment blocks using functions encoded within the rqtl and funqtl package 6064 the functions were called by a set of custom python and r scripts  two complimentary analysis methods were utilized first a single qtl model genome scan using haleyknott regression was performed to identify qtl exhibiting lod score peaks greater than a permutation based significance threshold   005 n  1000 next a stepwise forwardbackward selection procedure was used to identify an additive multiple qtl model based upon maximization of penalized lod score both procedures were performed at each time point within treatment blocks and on the numerical difference relative difference and trait ratio calculated between phenotypic values measured in treatment blocks at each time point qtl associated with difference or ratio composite traits may identify loci associated with genotype by environment interaction 65 qtls across different experiments were considered to be the same if they were in a 20cm window around the most commonly identified marker in that window tests for epistatic interaction between qtl were performed using the scantwo function in the rqtl package 60 epistasis between qtl was evaluated by comparing the log10 likelihood ratio of a model describing the additive and interaction between two qtl with a model only containing the additive interaction between two qtl the significance threshold was determined through permutation   005 n  100
 
the functionvalued approach described by kwak et al two thousand and sixteen 64 was used to identify qtl associated with the average slod and maximum mlod score at each locus throughout the experiment 64 the genotypic mean height within treatments was estimated using a logistic function and the qtl significance threshold was determined based upon permutationbased likelihood of observing the empirical slod or mlod test statistic across all grow outs separate independent linkage mapping analysis performed at each time point identified a larger number of qtl locations relative to similar function valued analysis based on the slod and mlod statistics calculated at each individual marker throughout the experimental time course
 
after refinement of qtl position estimates the significance of fit for the full multiple qtl model was assessed using type iii analysis of variance anova the contribution of individual loci was assessed using droponeterm type iii anova the proportion of variance explained by in addition to the allelic effect size of each locus were determined by comparing the fit of the full model to a submodel with one of the terms removed all putative protein coding genes setaria viridis genome version 11 found within a 15logarithm of the odds lod confidence interval were reported for each qtl
 
a search for orthologous genes associated with plant height putative causal genes was performed within the thirtyseven unique qtl intervals identified throughout the genome a curated list of plant height genes cloned from maize sorghum and rice was generated through literature review and searching maize gdb with search terms including height and dwarf the coding sequence name and genomic coordinates of each of these genes was downloaded from their speciesspecific repository maize gdb rice genome annotation project phytozome regions of genomic synteny between setaria viridis and maize sorghum or rice were identified using the synmap function encoded by the coge web tool default parameters 66 the genomic coordinates of coding sequences of interest were extracted from the coge text output using a custom python script  reciprocal blast searches were used to identify the location of orthologous genes not found in syntenic blocks the location of these sequences was plotted across the genome to examine their location relative to the coordinates of the qtl and median confidence interval at each location

written informed consent was obtained for all participants in accordance with the declaration of helsinki this project was also reviewed and approved by the montreal heart institute ethics committee and the different recruiting centers approval number 20141707
 
single variant association results considered in this effort were obtained from participants of european ancestry using an additive genetic model all phenotypes were corrected for confounding factors see below and normalized using inverse normal transformation the final analyses included samples from bcx1 up to 157622 participants airwave up to 14866 and the first release of the uk biobank up to 136084 genotypes for bcx1 and airwave were obtained from the illumina exomechip array the content is available at  the exomechip includes 250000 exonic variants obtained from wholeexome sequencing of 12000 participants the uk biobank samples were genotyped on the uk biobank axiom array the content of the arrays is available at  whereas the axiom array targets 800000 variants we only analyzed exonic variants that overlap with the content of the exomechip
 
phenotypic information and exomechip qualitycontrol steps and association results from cohorts involved in the bcx1 consortium and airwave have been described elsewhere 10 11 43 briefly we excluded variants with low genotyping success rate 95 except for whi that used a cutoff 90 samples with call rate 95 after joint or zcall calling and with outlying heterozygosity rate were also excluded other exclusions were deviation from hardyweinberg equilibrium p1x106 and gender mismatch we performed principal component analysis pca or multidimensional scaling mds and excluded sample outliers from the resulting plots using populations from the one thousand genomes project to anchor these analyses prior to performing metaanalyses of the association results provided by each participating study we ran the easyqc protocol 44 to check for population allele frequency deviations and proper trait transformation in each cohort in terms of hematological phenotypes we excluded individuals with blood cancer leukemia lymphoma bone marrow transplant congenital or hereditary anemia hiv endstage kidney disease dialysis splenectomy and cirrhosis and those with extreme measurements of rbc traits we also excluded individuals on erythropoietin treatment or chemotherapy additionally we excluded pregnant women and individuals with acute medical illness at the time the complete blood count cbc was done for all traits within each study we adjusted for age agesquared gender the first ten principal components and where applicable other studyspecific covariates such as study center using a linear regression model within each study we then applied inverse normal transformation on the residuals and tested the phenotypes for association with the exomechip variants using either rvtests version 20140416 45 or raremetalworker049 46
 
a description of methods and qualitycontrol procedures for the bloodcell data for the first release of the uk biobank can also be found elsewhere 1 description of the exomecomponent of the genotyping arrays used for the uk biobank samples can be found at  in the uk biobank we modelled bloodcell traits using the following covariates age sex menopause status for women assessment centre where the blood samples were collected machine counter that processed the blood samples month day of the week time inside the day that the samples were collected selfreported ethnic background of the individuals smoking status and smoking frequency alcohol drinker status alcohol intake frequency height and weight in the first release of the uk biobank we tested the association between directly genotyped or imputed variants and normalized hematological traits with boltlmm 47
 
we metaanalyzed results from bcx1 airwave and the uk biobank using inversevariance weighting as implemented in metal 48 we limited our analyses to variants with a mean minor allele frequency maf 1 in the metaanalyses that are annotated as coding missense or nonsense or splice site acceptor or donor using ensembls variant effect predictor vep furthermore the variants had to be present on the illumina exome array used by the bcx1 studies in total we tested 137086 variants against fifteen bloodcell traits these phenotypes are divided between the main three cell types found in blood red blood cells red blood cell count rbc count hemoglobin concentration hgb hematocrit hct mean corpuscular hemoglobin mch mean corpuscular volume mcv mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc and rbc distribution width rdw white blood cells total white blood cell count wbc count neutrophil count neutro lymphocyte count lympho monocyte count mono basophil count baso and eosinophil count eosin and platelets platelet count plt count and mean platelet volume mpv the metaanalysis results are available at  we used a conservative   5x108 to declare statistical significance at this statistical threshold our sample size n  308572 provides 99 power to discover variants with maf  01 that explain 003 of the phenotypic variance
 
to test whether the thirtyone rare variants newly identified in the metaanalyses are associated with bloodcell traits independently of other known genetic loci we regressed out the effect of the known bloodcell variants previously identified in the first release of the uk biobank 1 from the normalized bloodcell phenotypes all these analyses were done per phenotype that is we fitted fifteen different models for each of the fifteen bloodcell phenotypes tested we then retested in the uk biobank using linear regression implemented in r the association between the residual bloodcell phenotypes and genotypes at the rare variants identified in the metaanalyses for instance for hemoglobin we conditioned the new rare coding or splice site hemoglobin variants on all variants across the genome previously reported to associate with hemoglobin levels we provide the complete list of variants on which we conditioned in s5 table per bloodcell trait if the rare variants were not significantly associated with the residual phenotypes we then ran pairwise conditional analyses to identify which previously known variants at the locus accounted for the association signal identified in this project to declare statistical independence from previously reported hematological trait association signals we used   zero point zero zero two bonferroni correction for thirtyone variants tested

msea was used to identify coexpression modules with overrepresentation of cvd or t2dassociated genetic signals for each disease gwas in each cohortethnicity in a study specific manner msea takes into three input 1 summarylevel results of individual gwas whi fhs jhs cardiogramc4d diagram for the ldfiltered snps 2 snpgene mapping information which could be determined by tissuespecific ciseqtls encode based functional annotation and chromosome distance based annotation ciseqtls is defined as eqtls within 1mb of the transcription starting sites of genes for encode we accessed the regulome database and used the reported functional interactions to map snps to genes by chromosomal distance only snps within 50kb of the gene region and have functional evidence in regulome database were kept 3 datadriven coexpression modules from multiple human and mouse studies as described above tissuespecificity was determined by the tissue origins of eqtls and ethnic specificity was determined by the ethnicity of each gwas cohort since the human disease genetic signals and human eqtl mapping were the main driving factors to determine the significance of the modules msea employs a chisquare like statistic with multiple quantile thresholds to assess whether a coexpression module shows enrichment of functional disease snps compared to random chance 14 the varying quantile thresholds allows the statistic to be adoptable to studies of varying sample size and statistical power for the list of snps mapped to each geneset msea tested whether the snp list exhibited significant enrichment of snps with stronger association with disease using a chisquare like statistic i1noieiei where n denotes the number of quantile points we used ten quantile points ranging from the top 50 to the top 999 based on the rank of gwas p values o and e denote the observed and expected counts of positive findings ie signals above the quantile point and   one is a stability parameter to reduce artefacts from low expected counts for small snp sets the null background was estimated by permuting gene labels to generate random gene sets matching the gene number of each coexpression module while preserving the assignment of snps to genes accounting for confounding factors such as gene size ld block size and snps per loci for each coexpression module ten thousand permuted gene sets were generated and enrichment pvalues were determined from a gaussian distribution approximated using the enrichment statistics from the ten thousand permutations and the statistics of the coexpression module finally benjamihochberg fdr was estimated across all modules tested for each gwas
 
to evaluate a module across multiple gwas studies we employed the metamsea analysis in mergeomics which conducts modulelevel metaanalysis to retrieve robust signals across studies metamsea takes advantage of the parametric estimation of pvalues in msea by applying stouffers z score method to determine the metaz score then converts it back to a meta pvalue the metafdr was calculated using benjaminihochberg method coexpression modules with metafdr  5 were considered significant and included in subsequent analyses
 
we used graphical genegene interaction networks including the giant networks 31 and bayesian networks bn from twentyfive cvd and t2d relevant tissue and cell types s7 table s1 text to identify kds if more than one dataset was available for a given tissue a network was constructed for each dataset and all networks for the same tissue were combined as a union to represent the network of that tissue with the consistency of each network edge across datasets coded as edge weight the coexpression modules genetically associated with cvd or t2d identified by metamsea were mapped onto these graphical networks to identify kds using the weighted key driver analysis wkda implemented in mergeomics 14 wkda uniquely consider the edge weight information either in the form of edge consistency score in the case of bns or edge confidence score in the case of giant networks specifically a network was first screened for suitable hub genes whose degree number of genes connected to the hub is in the top 25 of all network nodes once the hubs have been defined their local oneedge neighborhoods or subnetworks were extracted all genes in each of the cvd and t2dassociated gene sets that were discovered by metamsea were overlaid onto the hub subnetworks to see if a particular subnetwork was enriched for the genes in cvdt2d associated gene sets the edges that connect a hub to its neighbors are simplified into node strengths strength  sum of adjacent edge weights within the neighborhood except for the hub itself the test statistic for the wkda is analogous to the one used for msea oee except that the values o and e represent the observed and expected ratios of genes from cvdt2d gene sets in a hub subnetwork in particular enknpn is estimated based on the hub degree nk disease gene set size np and the order of the full network n with the implicit assumption that the weight distribution is isotropic across the network statistical significance of the diseaseenriched hubs henceforth kds is estimated by permuting the gene labels in the network for ten thousand times and estimating the pvalue based on the null distribution to control for multiple testing stringent bonferroni adjustment was used to focus on the top robust kds kds shared by cvd and t2d modules are prioritized based on the following criteria i bonferronicorrected p zero point zero five in wkda ii replicated by both giant networks and bayesian networks and iii the genetic association strength between the kd subnetworks immediate network neighbors of the kds and cvdt2d in metamsea finally cytoscape 330 61 was used for disease subnetwork visualization
 
we used the genetic effect direction of kds as a proxy for probable effect direction of the kd subnetworks for each kd we retrieved their tissuespecific eqtls as well as variants within 50kb of the gene region whose genetic association information was available in both cardiogramplusc4d and diagram the two large metaconsortia of gwas for cvd and t2d cvdt2d association betavalues of mapped variants of kds were then extracted and the signs of betavalues were examined to ensure they were based on the same reference alleles between gwas lastly for all mapped variants on each kd the signs of the betavalue for cvd and t2d were compared and statistical significance of the proportion of variants with similar or opposite effect direction between diseases was determined by ztest

individuals 14 had unexplained id or developmental delay and were ascertained through familybased whole exome sequencing in a diagnostic setting in the department of human genetics at radboudumc and maastrichtumc exome sequencing and data analysis were performed as previously described in the probands and their unaffected parents 29 individual five was ascertained during a clinical genetic workup due to failure to thrive and lack of expected normal childhood development at childrens hospital colorado aurora colorado chromosomal microarray analysis for individual five was performed using both copy number and singlenucleotide polymorphism snp probes on a whole genome array cytoscan hd platform affymetrix santa clara ca the kmt2c deletion was confirmed to be de novo by parental microarray testing additionally this deletion was confirmed using locusspecific qpcr the primer pairs used were directed to kmt2c and two adjacent negative control regions s10 table all data were analyzed and reported using the february two thousand and nine hg19 human genome build
 
although all individuals harbored de novo loss of function mutations in kmt2c fig 1a exome results revealed that individual one and two carry one or two additional de novo mutations that do not appear to be related to the core phenotype of the individuals presented here individual one carried a second de novo truncating mutation in phf21a which is located in the 11p112 contiguous gene deletion syndrome named potockishaffer syndrome pss omim 601224 61 62 three individuals with translocation breakpoints through phf21a were reported previously and it was concluded that this gene was associated with the pss however no intragenic loss of function mutations are reported in association with this syndrome so far the mutation in individual one is present in the last exon of the gene and is therefore not subjected to nonsense mediated rna decay however it is possible that this variant may contribute to the phenotype observed in this patient
 
in individual two we found the kmt2c change c7550cg pser2517 in mosaic in blood individual two carries two additional de novo missense mutations in c11orf35 ppro602leu and ubr5 parg1907his protein function or mutations associated with other diseases for c11orf35 are not known and thus we cannot rule out that this variant may contribute to the patient phenotype with respect to ubr5 the same mutation has been previously described in a family with adult myoclonic epilepsy 63 but that family was not associated with idneuro developmental delay the missense change in ubr5 individual two is therefore unlikely to cause his id and autism moreover no epilepsy is present in this individual at age ten point

the spontaneous mutation rates were measured using a fluctuation test at least 918 cultures which were started from single colonies of twofour independent isolates of the same genotype were used to determine the spontaneous mutation rate the cultures were grown to saturation in three ml ypdau medium 1 yeast extract 2 bactopeptone 2 dextrose sixty mgl adenine sixty mgl uracil at 30c the saturated cultures were diluted in sterile water and appropriate dilutions were plated on a synthetic complete sc medium to determine the total number of cells in the cultures and on a selective medium to determine the total number of the mutant cells in the cultures unless noted otherwise the selective medium for foar cells was a sc medium containing one gl 5foa and five mm nam sc  5foa  nam and the selective medium for canr cells was a sc medium that lacked arginine and contained sixty mgl lcanavanine and five mm nam the plates were incubated for 34 days at 30c and the colonies were counted 570 of the foar colonies grew on a scura  five mm nam medium foar cells which formed these colonies were excluded from calculations of the mutation rates to identify foar colonies that were ura foar colonies formed on the fluctuation test plates were replicaplated onto the scura  five mm nam medium and the plates were incubated for one day at 30c
 
the mutation rates were calculated from the total numbers of cells and mutants in the cultures using the drakes formula   lnn 103 where  is mutation rate per replication  is the median mutant frequency and n is population size

the metsim study was performed in accordance with the helsinki declaration and was approved by the research ethics committee hospital district of northern savo number 1712004 all study participants gave their written informed consent
 
among the 10197 participants in the metsim study we analyzed 8372 nondiabetic individuals mean age 577 sd years and bmi 26838 kgm255
 
we measured the seventytwo lipid and lipoprotein traits from blood serum samples by proton nmr as previously described56 briefly lipid samples are extracted and measured by proton nmr and the nmrspectra and automated phasing are compared to plate background and serum controls regression modeling is used to quantify the spectral areas to produce the quantified molecular data the samples included sixty lipoprotein subclasses six cholesterol and triglyceride measures three cholesterol diameter measures and three apolipoprotein measurements s1 table definition of the subclass traits has been previously described5657 we visualized the pearson correlation matrix between lipoprotein traits using a corrgram with the ellipse  and lattice packages  within r s2 fig58
 
we genotyped the study samples using the humanomniexpress12v1c beadchip and infinium humanexome12 v10 beadchip resulting in 631879 and 236849 variants respectively imputation was performed using the got2d reference panel of 19m variants snps indels and large deletions based on wholegenome sequence of 2657 europeans consisting of german swedish finnish and british participants with the majority of the cohort comprised of finns59 the resulting 15144991 variants were subjected to quality controls including sample and variantlevel controls for detecting sample contamination sex and relatedness confirmation and detection of sample outliers using principalcomponent analysis to exclude samples with evidence of dna contamination we used bafregress v09  based on principal component analysis eighteen exome array sample duplicates one individual each from seven monozygotic twin pairs and twelve population outliers were removed from analysis due to sex chromosome inconsistencies fourteen omniexpress samples were removed samples with low genotype call rate 95 for either array were removed variants with lowmapping quality to build hg19 low genotype completeness 95 for omniexpress and 98 for exome array or multiallelic variants were removed the remaining high quality variants were phased using shapeit v260
 
we tested for association using imputed dosages for all variants with summed minor allele count dosage 1 with each of the seventytwo lipid and lipoprotein traits assuming an additive model and accounting for cryptic relatedness using the emmax linear mixed model approach as implemented in epacts  traits were adjusted for age age2 smoking status and lipid lowering medication residuals were inverse normalized to assess the level of genomic inflation we calculated the genomic control statistic gc for all of the traitvariant associations using r58 s1 fig reported effect size regression coefficients betas sizes are given in standard deviation units the rare lead associated variants that were imputed and had maf001 were tested for genotype accuracy by using taqman assays thermo fisher scientific or sanger sequencing in four hundred and ninetynine metsim participants who carried one or more rare alleles at these variants variants that had 10 discordance between the imputed genotype and the sequenced genotype in the examined individuals were removed from the analysis variants with maf0001 were excluded from analysis s5 table
 
to identify variant association signals distinct or independent from those reported previously we identified variants previously reported to be associated with any cholesterol lipid lipoprotein or triglyceride trait we performed a literature review of gwas and sequencing studies using pubmed  and google scholar  screened a gwas catalog  and used snipper  to query publicly accessible databases the resulting curated list contained 1714 variants at 150 loci from thirtythree studies s3 table the resulting curated list contained 1714 variants at 150 loci from thirtythree studies s3 table we used this list to represent the known genomewide lipid and lipoproteinassociated variants
 
we ldpruned r2095 the compiled list of 1714 variants s3 table to eight hundred and eightyfive variants s4 table and we used this list n  885 in genomewide conditional tests of association this stringent ld threshold facilitates conditioning on multiple known signals at a locus signals that remained significant pconditional5108 after genomewide conditional analysis were considered novel and further tested by singlevariant conditional analyses to determine independence at each of the five loci table 1 variants within one mb up and downstream of the lead variant and on the compiled list of 1714 variants were included in singlemarker conditional analyses s6 table signals that remained significant psingle5108 after singlevariant conditional analysis were considered independent signals that only achieved a significance threshold of psingle5106 after singlevariant conditional analysis were considered distinct the singlevariant conditional analyses considered variants within one mb of the signal which accounts for 1 of the genome therefore the significance thresholds for the distinct and independent additional signals are conservative at each locus we validated that signals were distinctindependent by reciprocal conditional analysis with the putative novel lead associated variant for the trait additionally the association data for the novel signals was adjusted for each of the four conventional traits hdlc ldlc tc and tg and the effect of the association is reported in s7 table
 
for each of the eight hundred and eightyfive lipidlipoproteinassociated variants s4 table we determined whether the variant showed stronger association with one of the sixtyeight subclass traits compared to the four conventional lipid traits tc tg ldlc hdlc variants were included for comparison if the variant association with a subclass trait satisfied p5105 and iflog10pvalue for subclass trait association was greater than any of the four conventional lipid traits
 
to determine the contribution of rare coding variants we used the optimal sequence kernel association test skato with emmax as implemented in epacts to test for genebased associations with the seventytwo lipoprotein traits61 only coding variants directly genotyped on the omniexpress or exome array were included resulting in 709600 variants since skato requires no missing data we imputed missing genotype data with the variant mean genotype we annotated coding variants using vep these annotations were the basis for four masks that we implemented in the genebased tests as previously described53 briefly the four masks were proteintruncating variants ptv no maf limit variants are nonsense frameshift or essential splice variants ptvmissense maf1 all ptvs and missense variants ptvnonsynonymous strict nsstrict no maf limit all ptvs and missense variants predicted as deleterious by five variant annotation algorithms lrt mutation taster polyphen2humdiv polyphen2humvar and sift ptvnsstrictnsbroad maf1 all variants in ptvnsstrict and variants predicted to be deleterious by any of the five algorithms above only genes containing two or more variants in a given mask were tested we conducted genebased conditional analyses to determine whether a single variant or a neteffect of multiple variants could explain the observed association signal
 
to better characterize the novel signals from this study we determined whether the associated lead variants and ld proxies r207 in metsim at each signal were within chipseq peaks of epigenomic transcriptional regulatory elements s8 table we built lists of such elements using data from the encode consortium62 and roadmap epigenomics project63 we used datasets from three lipid and cholesterol relevant tissues adipose blood and liver datasets that were comprised of experimentally defined regions of transcription factor binding sites chipseq open chromatin dnase and faireseq and histone modification marks h3k4me1 h3k4me2 and h3k4me3 h3k27ac and h3k9ac

we constructed an outbred population of flies using ten lines from the drosophila genetic reference panel dgrp 80 81 with the most extreme night sleep phenotypes for both sexes combined five lines had the shortest average night sleep for both males and females in the population dgrp38 dgrp310 dgrp365 dgrp808 and dgrp832 18 the other five lines had the longest average night sleep in the population dgrp235 dgrp313 dgrp335 dgrp338 and dgrp379 18 all ten lines were crossed in a full diallel design resulting in one hundred crosses two virgin females and two males from the f1 of each cross were then randomly mixed together and placed into twenty bottles with ten males and ten females in each bottle at each generation thereafter twenty virgin females and twenty males from each bottle were randomly mixed with the other flies and a new generation of twenty bottles was reared each generation of random mating had a census population size of eight hundred point the genomes of these flies were allowed to recombine in this manner for twentyone generations resulting in an advanced intercross population of flies we named the sleep advanced intercross population saip
 
flies were maintained and assayed on standard food  in constant temperature 25c humidity 60 and lightdark cycle 12hr12hr to measure sleep we collected male and female virgins from each population virgins were maintained in singlesex vials of twenty flies for four days before the experiment began ie five vials per sex per population to control for any potential effects on sleep of mating status 125 and social exposure 147 individual flies were loaded into drosophila activity monitors dam2 trikinetics waltham ma and sleep and activity parameters were recorded for five days the monitors use an infrared beam to detect activity counts in individual flies as they move past it five minutes without an activity count is defined as sleep 42 43 to mitigate the effects of co2 anesthesia or any other potential acclimation effects the first day of data recording was discarded flies were visually examined after the sleep and activity recordings were completed data from any flies that did not survive the recording period was discarded sleep analysis v61 software r s barnes personal communication was used to calculate night and day sleep duration in minutes night and day sleep bout number and night and day average sleep bout length it also calculated sleep latency the time in minutes to the first sleep bout after lights are turned off and waking activity the number of activity counts per minute spent awake in addition we calculated the coefficient of environmental variation cve for each sleep trait as e100 148 where e is the withinreplicate population standard deviation and  is the withinreplicate mean we used an inhouse c program r s barnes personal communication to partition the activity counts for each fly as asleep awake or in a transient pause 1 to four minutes of inactivity we used this information to calculate the percentage of flies in each state over time
 
at generation zero of the selection procedure we divided the outbred population into six populations by seeding six bottles with twentyfive randomly chosen flies of each sex two populations served as replicate unselected controls c1 and c2 two populations were selected for long night sleep l1 and l2 and two populations were selected for short night sleep s1 and s2 we measured sleep in one hundred males and one hundred females from each of these populations prior to initiating the artificial selection procedure we calculated differences in sleep among these populations using an anova model see quantitative genetics of selection below for the model the resulting analyses indicated that there were no significant differences in any sleep trait among these populations with the exception of night bout number s1 fig generation zero of s2 table thus each population had essentially the same phenotypic characteristics prior to selection
 
we implemented the following artificial selection procedure each generation first one hundred virgins of each sex were collected from each population bottle and placed into the sleep monitors sleep and activity were monitored continuously over a fiveday period second we calculated all sleep parameters for every fly in each selection population for the four selection populations l1 l2 s1 and s2 the twentyfive males and females with the most extreme high or low night sleep within each population were chosen as parents for the next generation of that population for the control populations c1 and c2 we chose twentyfive males and twentyfive females at random to be the parents for the next generation of each population we repeated this procedure for thirteen generations after generation 13 the six populations were maintained by seeding culture bottles with twentyfive randomly chosen flies of each sex
 
we subjected artificiallyselected flies to sleep deprivation at generation sixty using the following procedure individual flies were loaded into the dam2 trikinetics monitors using the protocol above after allowing the flies to acclimate in the monitors for one day we recorded normal sleep and activity for two days we deprived the flies of sleep on the night of the third day using a standard vortexer troemner thorofare nj with a custom mounting plate trikinetics waltham ma the vortexer gently shook speed  20 the flies for five seconds every minute of the 12hour night sleep period we allowed the flies to recover for two additional days an identical set of flies was placed into trikinetics monitors on a different shelf in the same incubator to serve as a nonsleepdeprived control we repeated these experiments two times we used this protocol to deprive the long l1 and l2 and shortsleeper s1 and s2 populations we also applied this protocol to deprive the minos element lines see below of sleep we used an inhouse python program to calculate the number of flies asleep during any given minute and to compute the average amount asleep per thirty minutes we examined the overall efficacy of the sleep deprivation protocol for each populationline separately using the anova model y    t  d  s  td  ts  ds  tds   where t is the control or sleep deprived treatment d is day and s is sex to determine whether night andor day sleep changed across days for the sleepdeprived group and their respective controls we analyzed the data for each populationline separately using the reduced anova model y    d  s  ds   where d and s are as defined above posthoc tukey analysis was used to determine which days had significant changes in sleep duration in addition to assess sleep deprivation in the minos lines we assessed differences between mutants and controls per day using the model y    t  l  s  tl  ts  sl  tls   where t and s are as defined above and l is line
 
we evaluated two different lifehistory traits in the selected and control populations of flies at generation 14 flies were assayed for lifespan one hundred male and female virgins of each population were placed into ten replicate vials per sex per population with ten samesex flies per vial every two days the flies were tipped into vials containing fresh food and deaths were recorded until all flies were dead flies were assayed for eggtoadult viability for nine generations beginning at generation four and continuing through generation twelve point two replicate fly cultures per population per generation were seeded with twentyfive flies of each sex parents were cleared from the vials after three days and the numbers of adult flies emerging were counted from days 1014
 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the selection procedure we used the equation y    sel  repsel  sex  gen  selsex  selgen  repselsex  repselgen  sexgen  selsexgen  repselsexgen   where y is night sleep duration sel is the selection procedure short or long night sleep gen is the fixed effect of generation rep is the random effect of replicate population and  is the variance within populations 68 a significant p  005 sel term indicates that the selection procedure was effective and a significant selsex term reveals sexspecific responses to selection a significant selgen selsexgen term implies that the response to selection differed across generations and sexes we used the same model to determine whether the other sleep parameters and eggtoadult viability had a correlated response to selection for night sleep to further characterize sex and generationspecific responses to selection for night sleep we used the reduced model y    sel  repsel  gen  selgen  repselgen   to evaluate sleep characteristics in each sex separately and the reduced models y    sel  repsel  sex  selsex  repselsex   and y    sel  repsel   to analyze the response to selection in each generation separately and for each generation in each sex separately respectively the model y    sel  repsel  sex  selsex  repselsex   was used for the lifespan analysis all analyses were implemented using sas cary nc to assess the response of night sleep to selection we used the breeders equation r  h2s to calculate the realized heritability h2 where r is the cumulated response to selection calculated as the mean night sleep of the offspring minus the mean night sleep of the parental generation and s is the cumulated selection differential calculated as the mean night sleep of the selected parents minus the mean night sleep of the parental generation 67 the same equation was used to assess changes in night sleep in the unselected control except that the cumulated response is more properly termed cumulative difference and the slope is the coefficient of the regression rather than the realized heritability
 
for each generation of selection we flashfroze thirtyfive flies of each sex from each of the selection and control populations we extracted dna from these flies using a cell lysis solution 158 g of trishcl quality biological gaithersburg md thirtyseven point two two g edta disodium salt quality biological gaithersburg md and filled to one liter with rnasednasefree water adjusting the ph to eight point zero with ten m naoh sigma aldrich st louis mo when necessary flies were homogenized in three hundred l of cell lysis solution and four to six two point three eight mm metal beads omni international kennesaw ga using an omni bead ruptor 5 cycles of five seconds on five seconds offsetting five ms equal to three thousand one hundred rpm omni international kennesaw ga an additional four hundred l of cell lysis solution one hundred and twenty l of 10 sds invitrogen grand island ny and sixty l of proteinase k life technologies grand island ny were added and the samples were incubated at 65c for one hour the lysate was then transferred to a clean one point five ml tube leaving the beads behind rna was eliminated from the lysate by adding three point five l rnase a 20 mgml life technologies grand island ny mixing and incubating at 37c for fifteen minutes protein precipitation was initiated by adding two hundred l of ammonium acetate quality biological gaithersburg md solution 2891 g of ammonium acetate in five hundred ml of rnasednasefree water to tubes chilled on ice for five minutes samples were vortexed at high speed for twenty seconds to mix incubated on ice for fifteen minutes and then centrifuged at maximum speed for five minutes the supernatant was then transferred to a clean one point five ml tube and three l of glycogen qiagen valencia ca was added seven hundred l of 100 isopropanol vwr international radnor pa was added and mixed to precipitate the dna samples were incubated for one hour at 20c the samples were then centrifuged at maximum speed for five minutes the supernatant was poured off and the dna pellet was washed with six hundred l of 75 ethanol nih supply center gaithersburg md then centrifuged at maximum speed for five minutes the ethanol was poured off and the pellet airdried for fifteen minutes samples were rehydrated in one hundred and twenty l of rnasednasefree water
 
dna samples were then purified using a phenolchloroform extraction first eighty l of ten mm tris quality biological gaithersburg md one mm edta ph seven point eight and two hundred l of fresh phenolchloroformisoamyl alcohol 25241 sigma aldrich st louis mo were added to the dna sample the samples were vortexed for thirty seconds then centrifuged at maximum speed in a 4c centrifuge for five minutes the resulting upper layer  one hundred and seventy l was transferred to a fresh 15ml tube an equal volume of chloroform nih supply center gaithersburg md 200 l was added the sample was vortexed and centrifuged at maximum speed in a 4c centrifuge for five minutes the resulting upper layer  one hundred and fifty l was transferred to a fresh 15ml tube next twenty l of sodium acetate naoac sigma aldrich st louis mo five hundred l of pure ethanol and one l glycogen were added the sample was mixed and placed in ice for fifteen minutes afterwards the samples were centrifuged at maximum speed in a 4c centrifuge for thirty minutes the supernatant was removed and the pellet washed with zero point five ml of 70 ethanol the sample was centrifuged at maximum speed for five minutes the supernatant was removed and the sample airdried for five minutes the resulting dna pellet was dissolved in twentyfive l sterile ten mm tris zero point one mm edta ph seven point eight and heated for two minutes at 55c dna quantity was measured and quality evaluated 260280 ratios of one point eight or greater using the nanodrop eight thousand thermo fisher scientific asheville nc
 
we sequenced dna from each selection population and sex for the following generations 0 1 2 5 8 10 and twelve point one microgram of genomic dna was sheared to 350 bp using a covaris e210 covaris woburn ma with settings duty cycle 10 intensity 5 cyclesburst 200 time 45s libraries were constructed using the truseq dna pcrfree lt sample prep kit illumina san diego ca according to the manufacturers protocol the libraries were pooled in groups of twentyfour and run on a hiseq2500 illumina san diego ca with version three sequencing reagents to generate a minimum of thirtyseven million pairedend one hundred and twentysix base reads per library the hiseq data was processed using rta11864 and casava 182
 
sequences were aligned and mapped to the d melanogaster assembly bdgp release 6 ucsc version dm6 using with burrowswheeler alignmentmem version 0712 149 and novoalign version 30207 novocraft technologies selangor malaysia using the t four hundred option to optimize alignment speed we used previously identified informative snps and indels in freeze two point zero of the dgrp 81 after converting the coordinates to the release six assembly 150 reads were realigned around indels from this set of polymorphisms with gatk version 281 151 duplicate reads were removed with samtools version 0118 after alignment merging and sorting of the reads novel variants were discovered using lofreq version 212 82 with default parameters we retained variants called by lofreq that occurred in fourteen or more samples allele counts for all single nucleotide variant sites both known dgrp freeze two point zero and novel lofreq polymorphisms were determined using the bamcounts command of the bardcnv package  with the option minqual twenty to filter reads for a minimum phred quality of twenty point counts for reads spanning indels were performed by first widening indel variants to their narrowest unambiguous region then tallying spanning reads both with and without the indel using the perl module biosamtools  confidence interval boundaries with the highest posterior density for the estimated read allele proportions were calculated in r using cran binom packages binombayes function for downstream analyses we considered all bialleleic polymorphisms with total coverage of ten and less than two thousand in each population 56
 
we used the cochranmantelhaenszel cmh test to detect changes in allele frequency for all known segregating 2222264 and putative de novo 258268 polymorphisms 83 between generations 01 12 25 58 810 and 1012 this test is unbiased easy to apply and has been previously used to identify candidate polymorphisms in evolve and resequence studies 56 59 we removed polymorphisms with less than ten total read counts or more than two thousand total read counts from the analysis we used a bonferronicorrected pvalue 23  108 as the threshold of significance for the cmh tests in order to account for multiple tests we made this calculation for both sexes combined as sleep in both sexes responded to the selection procedure pselsex  01501 s1 table despite the similarity in phenotypic changes among replicate long or shortsleeper populations few polymorphisms with significant allele frequency changes overlapped between replicate populations however significant cmh tests cannot distinguish among allele frequency changes that are responsible for the sleep phenotypes we observed and changes due to other forces that might alter allele frequency for example large numbers of frequency changes were potentially due to random genetic drift or laboratory adaptation as the numbers of significant polymorphisms in the control populations indicate nor can the cmh test account for differences in allele counts that arise due to differences in sequencing coverage 59 65 sampling bias or sequencing error we examined the overlap between candidate polymorphisms that were significant for the cmh test in the control population with those in the selected populations we eliminated polymorphisms that overlapped with the control populations as being indistinguishable from random genetic drift this left 69188 polymorphisms that overlapped between the long and shortsleeping populations we then applied a logistic regression model to the read count data of the form y  0  1gen  2sel  3gensel where y is allele type major or minor gen is generation and sel is selection scheme long or short both long and short selection population replicates for all seven generations and both sexes were put into the logistic regression analysis we required that the pvalue for the lack of fit be  zero point zero five higher pvalue indicates that there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the model fits the pvalue for sel to be  005 and the pvalue for gensel to be  zero point zero five 152 all analyses were implemented using sas cary nc
 
we chose 3600 snps at random per chromosome arm and calculated linkage disequilibrium among these snps for the ten dgrp lines using plink 107 153 to estimate ld between snps in the saip and resulting artificial selection populations we used the following procedure for each snp pair we designated one snp as snp a and the other as snp b we binned the minor allele frequency of snp a pa in zero point zero one increments from zero point zero one to 05 we then calculated the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding minor allele frequency at snp b pb that would result in an r2 of zero point eight or greater using the following formulations from vanliere et al 89
 
the lower bound of pb is r2pa1  r2papa
 
the upper bound of pb is the minimum of par2 r2pa  pa or 05
 
we determined whether the actual minor allele frequency at snp b was within the upper and lower bounds given by these two equations if it was we assumed that snp b was in high ld ie r2  08 with snp a
 
in addition we used the drosophila melanogaster recombination rate calculator  to estimate recombination rates for the one hundred and twentysix variants we identified using logistic regression estimates based on marey map equations 154 and on empirical observations of recombination 86 are included in s7 table
 
we compared the actual allele frequency changes in the control populations with simulated random genetic drift we first estimated the variance effective population size ne of our populations as net2ln12q01q0 where t is the time in generations q0 is the starting allele frequency at generation 0 and 2 is the variance in allele frequencies 155 using the snps that had significant cmh tests in the control populations ie those snps presumed to be drifting we binned the allele frequencies at generation zero from 005050 we then calculated the variance in allele frequency across snps in the control populations at generation twelve 65 we estimated ne using the equation above for each allele frequency bin at generation twelve point the median ne was fortytwo point five 21 males and twentyone females which we applied to the drift simulations drift was simulated for a single snp by random and independent sampling of parental genotypes over twelve generations for a given starting minor allele frequency 65 we simulated drift using starting minor allele frequencies that ranged from zero point zero one to zero point five in 001frequency increments each simulation for a given starting minor allele frequency was repeated 10000 times the entire process was replicated two times for the autosomes and two times for the x chromosome to represent the longsleeper and shortsleeper populations with replication we then calculated the absolute value of the average difference between short and long sleeper populations for each starting minor allele frequency the 999 quantile was used as an upper bound of the potential allele frequency change due to drift for each starting minor allele frequency 65

cells were fixed in 4 pfa in pbs for ten min washed twice with pbs permeabilized in 05 saponin sigma aldrich05 triton x100pbs for twenty min at rt and incubated in zero point one n hcl for fifteen min at rt afterwards cells were washed twice with 2x ssc and treated with rnase a 100 ugml in 2x ssc one h at rt after washing twice with 2x ssc cells were kept in 50 formamide2x ssc for at least thirty min at rt bac dnas were purchased from bacpac chori ch32176h10 and ch32128e07 dna was used directly as a template in a nick translation reaction including fluorescently labeled dutps ares kit molecular probes a probe mix containing 200400 ng of each fluorescently labeled probe one hundred gml yeast trna ambion one hundred gml salmon sperm in ten l of hybridization buffer 10 dextran sulfate 50 formamide 2x ssc 1 tween 20 was first incubated ten min at 80c and put on ice then added to cells incubated at 78c for three min and left to hybridize at 37c overnight excess probe was washed three times with each 1x ssc and 01x ssc at 42c for five min finally cells were stained in one gml dapi molecular probes prepared in pbs and mounted using prolong gold life technologies
 
cells were imaged on a zeiss lsm seven hundred and eighty confocal microscope using the 63x oil objective image stacks of 810 images at steps of one m were acquired first images from the same field of view and channel were maximally projected colocalization and radial measurements to nuclear periphery were performed using cellprofiler software and the pipelines for colocalization and speckle analysis respectively for radial analysis nuclei were subdivided starting from the center in concentric rings using the dapi channel and radial distance between objects nucleus and probe centroid distances normalized to nucleus diameter was calculated the normalized radial position of the fish signal was calculated at the spot center
 
for neurnaseq and mrnaseq raw reads were trimmed with cutadapt 29 v one point one zero to remove any adapters and polya tails while performing light quality trimming using parameters qualitycutoff  20minimumlength  25overlap  ten a aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt a agatcggaagagc trimmed reads were mapped to the primary chromosomes 2l 2r 3l 3r 4 x y and mitochondriongenome of the flybase release six point one one dm6 assembly with hisat2 204 30 using default parameters reads were counted in annotated genes in flybase release six point one one using featurecounts v150p3 31 since neurnaseq enriches for nascent rna and the libraries are stranded we counted reads in full gene bodies using featurecounts parameters s one t gene g geneid f for the unstranded mrnaseq libraries we counted reads in exons using parameters t exon g geneid
 
for neurnaseq counts tables were loaded into deseq2 v1101 32 counts tables from independent neurnaseq experiments siago2dslaminbmock dsdcr2mock rescue constructs were independently imported and normalized using simple design treatment and using otherwise default parameters differentially expressed genes were those with an adjusted pvalue  01
 
for mrnaseq the older libraries were originally analyzed with an older set of programs and algorithms specifically deseq v1 33 instead of deseq2 a major difference is that deseq2 shrinks the log2 fold change estimates for genes with low information ie low number of counts or high variance across replicates notably nht is expressed at very low levels in both wt and ago2 mutant flies deseq v1 detects nht as statistically significantly upregulated in ago2 mutants the ago2 catalyticindependent gene list go analysis and followup experiments were based on this original observation however we found that nht is not significantly differentially expressed using deseq2 since followup rtpcr confirmed that nht is in fact upregulated in ago2 mutants we conclude that deseq2 gives a false negative for nht likely because of its low expression consistent with the known conservative behavior of deseq2 in calling differentially expressed genes especially at low expression levels
 
we estimated gene expression by running salmon v081 34 on an index built from the transcriptome fasta file from flybase release 611 using a k of twentyfive bp for our data containing fifty bp reads and using default parameters in addition to the parameter l sf for each gene the reported transcriptlevel expression estimates in transcripts per million tpm were summed to give a total tpm value for each gene gene tpms were averaged within replicates of each experiment to give a single value for each treatment for each experiment
 
genes upregulated in ago251b null mutant but not in ago2v966m catalytic mutant female larva mrnaseq libraries were analyzed for biological process goterm enrichment in flymine  an integrated database for drosophila genomics 35 the same gene can appear in more than one category the actual source for go analysis is the gene ontology consortium  36
 
trimming reads for adapters and light quality trimming was performed with cutadapt v110 using the parameters qualitycutoff twenty a agatcggaagagcminimumlength  25overlap  10 reads were aligned to the same reference genome described above for rnaseq using bowtie2 v228 37 with default parameters multimapping reads were removed using the view program of samtools v131 38 with parameter q 20 the picard tools v250  program markduplicates was used to remove pcr duplicates from mapped reads
 
peak calling methods depended on whether the binding of the protein is punctate ago2 or broad pol ii in both cases we first used the macs2 v21120160309 callpeak program 39 and  to call peaks on each replicate independently for both ago2 and pol ii we used the nondefault parameters gsize dmbdgspmr for pol ii we additionally included the parameter broad we then ran the same peakcalling steps but on the pooled set of replicates for each target protein by providing all input and ip replicates to macs2 the signal bedgraph outputs from the pooled peakcalling runs were used in screenshots for figures
 
for the punctate ago2 peaks we used the irreproducible discovery rate idr method using idr v203 40  and following recommendations from  initial lenient peaks were called with macs2 with the lenient parameters p 1e3nomodeltolarge on four versions of the ip data replicates pooled pseudoreplicates bam files generated by pooling all replicates shuffling the result and then splitting back out an equal number of reads into separate pseudoreplicate bam files selfpseudoreplicates shuffleandsplit each replicate individually and pooled replicates pooled input was always used as the control for these peakcalling runs on each pair of replicate selfpseudoreplicate and pooledpseudoreplicate called peaks we ran idr with parameters usebestmultisummitidrsoftidrthreshold 005rank pvalueinputfiletype narrowpeakpeaklist pooled where pooled is the peaks called on all replicates pooled together from the pooled peaks ranked by increasing pvalue we chose the final ago2 peaks as the top n peaks were n was the number of peaks in the pooledpseudoreplicate comparison passing an idr threshold of 005 as recommended by the idr authors
 
the idr method has not been tested on broad peaks and as such the authors do not recommend using it in such cases we therefore selected final peaks for pol ii as those peaks in the pooled peakcalling run that were also found in at least one of the individual replicates specifically using bedtools v2250 and pybedtools v079 4142 we used pooledintersectreplicates u  truesortmerge where pooled points to the pooled peak calls and replicates is the list of individual peak calls for each replicate
 
when comparing ago2 chipseq peaks to genes changed upon ago2 depletion we considered a gene bound by ago2 if it had an ago2 peak overlapping at least one of the gene tsss by at least one bp in all other comparisons we considered a gene bound by a protein if the protein overlapped anywhere in the gene body by at least one bp
 
we used the 4cker algorithm 17 to analyze 4cseq data following the authors recommendations documented in  the reduced genome was created around hindiii sites with the fragment size of thirteen bp on either side the primer sequence was accgtttttgacaacagcagctgta and was flanked by a hindiii site starting at genomic position chr2l15318918 in the dm6 assembly results from the nearbait analysis mode defined by 4cker to be five mb on either side of the bait are presented here and used k  5 and pval  005 postprocessing of the 4cker results files were required to identify the direction of interaction changes gainloss specifically the bedgraph signal output which contains values for overlapping windows of different sizes was intersected with each differential region for the each treatment and control replicate using bedtools and pybedtools the gainloss fold change was calculated as the weighted average of treatment window signals divided by the weighted average of control window signals intersecting each differential region
 
chromatin colors from 9 were downloaded from geo accession gse22069 and lifted over to the dm6 assembly using liftover from the ucsc tools 43 tads from 8 were downloaded from  8 and lifted over to the dm6 assembly lads from 11 were downloaded from supplemental data original lad data were in the dm2 assembly so we performed a 2stage liftover first from dm2 to dm3 and then from dm3 to dm6
 
all fets used the implementation in the python scipy package scipystatsfisherexact when comparing intervals peaks tads with genes we considered the entire gene body reported pvalues are twotailed when multiple tests were performed eg for heatmaps in fig 3 we applied the benjaminihochberg multiple test correction fdr as implemented in the statsmodels python package statsmodelsstatsmultitestfdrcorrection where fdr is displayed in heatmaps if the odds ratio was 1 then the sign of the corresponding fdr was flipped such that negative values indicate depletion and positive values indicate enrichment where logodds ratio is displayed in heatmaps if the fdr was  zero point zero five then the log odds was set to zero
 
for computing colocalization between sets of intervals we used the genomic association test v122 framework 44 using the dm6 assembly as the domain or workspace and otherwise default parameters in the heatmaps showing log2 fold change enrichment any comparisons where the qvalue was 005 was reset to have a log2 fold change of zero and any selfself comparisons were set to zero
 
data are available from the following geo accessions gse101365 chipseq gse95844 mrnaseq gse95845 neurnaseq and gse95847 4cseq the following link contains the setup code and documentation to reproduce the analysis and generate all figures

our previous point analyses in yeast were based on human curated datasets 19 49 we do not have such inferences for either the at or the grass  event instead using experience from previous projects 40 50 we developed a new pipeline for inferring the paralogous genomic regions created by a wgd in the genomes sharing that event we then merged these regions of dcs 20 21 across all polyploid genomes and sought an ancestral gene order that minimized the number of synteny breaks fig one shows examples of such dcs blocks for at
 
the goal of the pipeline is to find a common set of dcs blocks shared by the genomes of the six brassicaceae species that possess at arabidopsis thaliana 51 arabidopsis lyrata 52 capsella rubella 53 shrenkiella parvula 54 formerly known as thellungiella parvula or erroneously as thellungiella halophila 55 eutrema salsugineum 56 and aethionema arabicum 57 and for the four grasses with  brachypodium distachyon 58 oropetium thomaeum 59 setaria italica 60 and sorghum bicolor 61 to do so we used outgroup genomes that lacked the wgd in question for the at event we used the draft genome of the outgroup plant cleome violacea which split from the six taxa studied prior to that event 11 it likewise lacks the wgd found in other taxa in the cleomaceae 9 the c violacea genome is available from the coge comparative genomics portal  under accession number twentythree thousand eight hundred and twentytwo point for the grass  event we used the genome of the pineapple ananas comosus as an outgroup 62 coge accession numbers for all plant genomes used are listed in s1 data
 
the product of a wgd is a set of duplicated genes in a genome that each originate from a single ancestral gene here the c violacea and pineapple genomes give us an estimate of these ancestral loci and we seek to place either one eg a duplicate loss has happened or two genes the ohnologs survive from the duplicated genome in a pillar with each such ancestral gene see fig 1 genome annotation files for these twelve plant genomes were obtained from coge 63 with these data in hand the inference of the shared dcs blocks that serve as points input is a three step process 1 a homology search of each polyploid genome against the diploid outgroup 2 inference of speciesspecific dcs blocks and 3 inference of a common set of dcs blocks across all genomes along with an estimate of their ancestral order at the time of the polyploidy
 
step 1 homology search for at we used a fast homology search program based on the seqan package 64 65 to identify pairs of homologous genes one from a genome with at and one from c violacea we defined a pair of genes as being homologous for the purposes of dcs inference if their protein sequences 1 share two seven amino acid residue exact matches 2 have the shorter sequence having 80 of the length of the longer and 3 show 70 amino acid identity overall because of the greater evolutionary distances involved in the grass  event we used a slower but more sensitive blastbased search employing our tool genomehistory to do so 66 67 in this case we required a maximal blast evalue of 108 to identify matches between the four duplicated grasses and pineapple we then used the same 70 identity and 80 aligned length cutoffs as used with at to select homologs
 
step 2 genomespecific dcs inference sequence homology alone is insufficient to identify the dcs blocks given the angiosperms history of nested polyploidy 1 instead for the second step of the pipeline we used gene order information synteny to identify which of the potentially many homologs in each polyploid genome are the wgdproduced ohnologs we frame this problem as follows first we define a set a of n dcs blocks that consists of ancestral pillars ai such that ai  a1  i  n each pillar is linked to a unique gene from c violacea or pineapple and has elements aip1 and aip2 which represent the potential homologous genes created by wgd each pillar ai also has associated a set of genes h1hh from the polyploid genome that are homologous to the pillars ancestral gene a maximum of two of these homologs can be assigned to aip1 and aip2 we next define oa1an to be the order of the pillars in a for our analysis hence aoi represents the ith pillar in this ordering for a given aoi pk1  k  2 define aoij pk such that j  minx i1xn where aoix pk   in other words ij is the next pillar after i in oa1an with an assigned gene for parental genome k we define the score s of such a combination of homolog assignments and pillar orders si1nk1210aoipkandaoijpkareneighborsotherwise1
 
in other words the score is the sum of the number of positions in oa1an where the genes in each pillar are the genomic neighbors of the genes in the next nonempty position we cannot simply use the pillar order seen in the outgroup because neither c violacea nor pineapple is the true ancestor of the wgd events in question both have evolved independently for many millions of years instead we must optimize oa1an note that throughout this pipeline neighbor is understood to exclude any genes that are not part of the current analysis set for instance a gene in arabidopsis thaliana with no identified c violacea homolog is ignored in the neighbor computation because it could never appear in an ancestral pillar by the same logic any position for which aoi pk and aoij pk are not neighbors is defined as a synteny break and if this situation is true for both k  one and k  2 we refer to position i as having a double synteny break
 
to infer the combination of the homolog assignments ai pk  one  i  n one  k  two and the ordering oa1an we used simulated annealing 68 69 this algorithm proposes random changes to either oa1an or to the aipk assignments with the goal of maximizing s which recomputed after each such change we used the extant c violacea and pineapple gene orders as our initial orders and made increasingly long runs until longer run times no longer produced meaningfully higher values of s
 
a thaliana and its relatives share a history of wgd 26 prior to the wgd event modeled here there was another wgd termed wgd which is shared with c violacea one might wonder if our simulated annealing algorithm has mistaken synteny blocks surviving from wgd for the more recent products of wgd we suspect that any such errors are quite rare for two reasons first c violacea also experienced wgd and hence also possesses the corresponding synteny blocks meaning that they are accounted for in the inputs to our simulated annealing routines second we only considered homology relationships between genes in c violacea and in a thaliana alyrata c rubella s parvula and e salsugineum with nonsynonymous divergence ka less than zero point one and between c violacea and a arabicum with ka02 as a result between 41 and 45 of the genes from c violacea have only a single homolog identified in the other six genomes and hence cannot represent ambiguous surviving blocks from wgd in c violacea hence it is difficult to see how ancestral wgd blocks would have infiltrated our inferences in significant numbers
 
step 3 inferring a global ancestral ordering for point analyses using the foursix individually optimized set of ancestral pillars for  and at respectively with assigned genes the aipk values for each genome we extracted for each genome only ancestral pillars for which each gene in the pillar had synteny support ie each gene was a neighbor of at least one other gene in that pillar set using the outgroup gene from each ancestral pillar as an index we then merged all of these inferences because we required that at least one gene from each genome be in each pillar the effect of this merging was to limit our analyses to a set of m  seven thousand two hundred and fortythree and  three thousand and ninetyone ancestral pillars for at and  respectively however those pillars have shared syntenic support across all genomes the optimal ancestral order for each extant genome differs so once the ancestral pillars were assembled we inferred a globallyoptimal ancestral order oag1agm again using simulated annealing the optimality criterion here was to maximize the number of neighbor relationships but in this case the aipk assignments were held constant and only oag1agm was changed
 
to assess the influence of the ancestral ordering on points estimates we fit the wgdbf model fig 2b to both the initial c violacea order and to the ten inferences of oag1agm with the largest simulated annealing scores using the order with the highest likelihood for further analyses s1 table we similarly used the ancestral ordering of highest likelihood for our  analyses
 
we employed a number of models of the fates of the duplicates produced by wgd a statistical relationships between the various models for the yeast wgd blue at green and  brown events the simplest model wgdn considers only a balanced process of gene loss from this model we can either allow duplicate genes to become fixed for instance by neo or subfunctionalization wgdf or for one of the two parental subgenomes to lose more genes than the other wgdb using a likelihood ratio test lrt we find that for all three wgd events allowing duplicate fixation significantly improves the fit of the data to the models p1010 lrt methods however for the yeast dataset there is no significant evidence for biased fractionation p05 lrt while for the two plant wgds adding it significantly improves the fit p1010 lrt from these two models we can then allow the other process again for yeast there is significant evidence for fixation but not biased fractionation p1010 and p05 respectively lrt while for at and  there is significant evidence for both p1010 in each case lrt we also tested a model where the biased fractionation parameter  see panel b was allowed to differ on the shared root branch of the tree wgdbtf compared to all of the other branches for the two plant wgd events there is no significant evidence that the level of biased fractionation differed early in history of the wgd relative to later in time p019 results on the other hand for the yeast wgd biased fractionation was much more intense soon after the polyploidy event and weakened later p  0001 results b model states and parameters our model has four states two duplicated ones u  undifferentiated duplicates and f  fixed duplicates and two single copy states s1 and s2 corresponding to the two parental subgenomes the base loss rate  is compounded with the estimated time to give the branch lengths of fig one point the relative fixation rate  0 gives the rate of duplicate fixation relative to the loss rate  likewise the fractionation bias parameter  01 gives the excess of preservations from subgenome one relative to subgenome two assumed to be the more fractionated subgenome
 
to assess if the fragmentation of synteny blocks was artificially leading us to invoke bf we also extracted from our full at dataset a smaller set of ancestral loci with strong syntenic support including only pillars with full syntenic support in at least one direction eg two links per pillar per genome the result was a dataset of mh  four thousand five hundred and fiftysix ancestral loci for which we also inferred an optimal ancestral ordering no such analysis was performed for  due to the small total number of ancestral pillars found table one gives the parameter estimates from all four datasets for various ancestral orders

we have previously described point 22 70 which fits a markov model to duplicate loci created by wgd the model has four states fig 2b namely u undifferentiated duplicated genes f fixed duplicate genes and s1 and s2 the single copy states it is a generalization of a model proposed by lewis 71 note that once the genes of each postwgd genome have been assembled into ancestral pillars using the simulated annealing approach above the sequences of the genes of the postwgd genomes are never used again all of points inferences are based on shared dcs information since our prior work we have completely rewritten point to allow for userdefined evolutionary models computing the resulting transition probabilities by exponentiating the usersupplied instantaneous rate matrix 72 using this new version of point we fit five models to our four datasets two from at and one each from the yeast and grass wgd events fig 2 we used likelihood ratio tests to assess whether more complex models better fit the loss data than did simpler models 73
 
points focus on wgd has advantages over applying more general gene birthdeath models to polyploid species 74 75 point models the process of duplicate loss and retention jointly across all genomes and along a phylogeny hence the probability of a particular model state at a given ancestral locus is conditioned on all other loci and all other genomes this conditioning is performed by analogy to the linkage analysis model of lander and green 76 using the hiddenmarkov approach of felsenstein and churchill 77 the states the markov model considers are the set of 2n possible orthology relationships between the 2n different loci eg two duplicated loci in each of n genomes the likelihood of site i1 having orthology state j given that site i has that orthology assignment is 1 where  is a small constant estimated from data 0000400081 across these analyses in cases where there is a double break in gene order in a particular genome   05
 
from this model structure we can infer orthologous chromosomal regions produced by wgd between the genomes studied along with confidence estimates in these inferences fig 1 the previous version of point did not distinguish between states s1 and s2 the result was degeneracy in the inferences of orthologous regions in other words assigning the first member of each dcs pair to subgenome one and the second to subgenome two produced orthology assignment one hundred and eleven thousand one hundred and eleven across the six genomes which was identical in likelihood to assignment two hundred and twentytwo thousand two hundred and twentytwo point the computation is completely analogous for the other two wgd events studied effectively this degeneracy corresponds to flipping the upper and lower panels of fig 1 because each of the 2n possible orthology assignments has an equivalent assignment with all 1s converted to 2s and vice versa
 
to model the process of bf we relaxed this assumption by introducing parameter  fig 2b this parameter makes losses to state s2 potentially less common than to s1 if bf is present in the data the maximum likelihood estimate of  will be less than 10 and the likelihood of orthology assignment one hundred and eleven thousand one hundred and eleven will no longer be the same as two hundred and twentytwo thousand two hundred and twentytwo point we can then use the point model to estimate the posterior probability of the subgenome assignments the numbers shown above every column in fig 1 at every pillar for convenience we refer to the resulting two regions as deriving from allopolyploid parents one and two 43 respectively defining parent one as containing genes in state s1 eg it is potentially less fractionated similar to thomas et al 39
 
in previous work in yeast 15 22 70 we found evidence for convergent gene losses that were phylogenetically independent and yet more often from the same subgenome than could be explained by chance we modeled these events by adding two duplicated converging states to our model c1 and c2 gene losses from c1 were always to s1 and similarly for c2 we fit versions of this model both with 0 10 and without   1 bf to our yeast grass and at data while these models improved the fit relative to the wgdbf model used here we present our results in terms of the wgdbf model because both model classes give similar parameter estimates s2 table and the more complex models do not add insight for the questions considered here
 
because we analyzed only four genomes sharing the grass  event it was possible to use point to test all fifteen possible rooted phylogenetic trees for these taxa to assess the dependence of our inferences on the inferred phylogeny we present our results in terms of the optimal tree but the global parameter estimates for the wgdbf model were very similar for all topologies 00610067 07190739 000610068 fig 2
 
we asked whether genes surviving from one or the other of the subgenomes showed patterns of interconnection in the networks of arabidopsis thaliana we use the biogrid database 78 to extract known proteinprotein interactions 79 we tested for paucity of interactions between the products of genes from different subgenomes with a randomization approach we thus compared the number of interactions between gene products from alternative subgenomes in the actual data to this value computed after one thousand randomizations of the subgenome assignments to assess the degree to which our conclusions were potentially affected by errors in the assignment of genes to subgenomes we conducted our tests at a range of confidences in subgenome assignment fig 3
 
we extracted singlecopy genes for a range of values of points overall confidence in pillar assignments to subgenomes xaxis and computed the pvalue for the test of the null hypothesis of no fewer proteinprotein interactions between products of genes from alternative subgenomes than expected yaxis panel a see methods we also computed the frequency of such crossing interactions relative to interactions between products of the same subgenome yaxis panel b
 
we used the gene list analysis tool from the panther classification system 80 to perform statistical overrepresentation tests to find overunderrepresented gene ontology go terms associated with biological processes molecular functions or cellular components the input of our analysis consists of two sets of genes the target list to analyze and a reference list the expected number of genes for a go term in the target list was calculated based on the number of genes with that term in the reference list binomial statistics for each go term associated with genes in the target list were then computed from these expectations 81
 
we first performed an overrepresentation test for 4086 single copy genes from both subgenomes against the reference set of 4152 surviving duplicated genes the overunder represented go terms in the analysis were filtered with a threshold pvalue  zero point zero one after bonferroni correction and only terms with a foldenrichment larger than one point five overrepresented or smaller than zero point six seven underrepresented are reported we next compared 2552 single copy genes from subgenome one dominant relative to the terms for the 1534 genes from subgenome two more fractionated with a similar approach to compensate for the smaller number of terms found to be enriched in this second analysis we used an fdrcorrected pvalue of zero point zero five as a threshold full lists of all significantly enriched terms for any comparison with associated go identifiers are given as s3s5 tables

all behavioral observations were performed at 25c 65 relative humidity and at the same time of day 1h after lights on with 34 day old flies unless indicated otherwise
 
newly eclosed flies were anesthetized and collected into vials with food where they were housed separately for three days at 25c in a 1212 lightdark cycle during that time flies were exposed to different social conditions single housed one fly in each vial group housed 5 same sex flies in each vial group mated 5 same sex flies with five opposite sex flies in each vial singlegroup housed with male scents or singlegroup housed with cva following exposure to different housing conditions experimental flies were lightly anesthetized using co2 and decapitated using a microscalpel at 12 hours after lights on making sure no antennae were damaged heads were then frozen in dry ice for totalrna extraction we chose to use whole heads and not to surgically remove antennae as this induces additional variability in the rna measurements
 
mesh experiments were performed by inserting experimental flies into a food vial containing an eppendorf tube with food in it the top of the eppendorf tube was cut and replaced with a plastic mesh this enables exposure of scents of group housing for the experimental flies without experiencing direct physical contact with other flies five male odor donor flies were placed in the eppendorf tube test flies were placed in the vial for 34 days at 25c 65 humidity at the end of the experiment experimental flies were removed for further processing decapitation for rna extraction or behavioral analysis
 
exposure to cva was performed by adding 1g or 10g of cva dissolved in ethanol onto a filter tip after the ethanol evaporated tips were placed in fly food vials and experimental flies were inserted into the vial cva was replaced every twentyfour hours for three days for expression analysis heads were frozen as in the above experimental procedure for rna extraction and rtqpcr analysis for behavioral tests threeday old female flies were exposed to cva either 24h or 1h before behavioral experiments they were then placed into courtship arenas with virgin four days old wt males for behavioral courtship analysis
 
light induced activation of the red shifted channel rhodopsin uascschrimson was achieved by placing fly vials over a red led covered plate 40 hz 650nm zero point six lm 20ma activation protocol consisted of three fifteen min long activation with resting intervals of fortyfive min first activation started at 1h after lights on flies were then lightly anesthetized and decapitated heads were frozen 2025 minutes after final activation ended

the variant rs10166942 is located 1 kb upstream of the trpm8 gene we used a combination of bioinformatics tools to investigate possible functional effects of rs10166942 and it neighboring variants in high linkage disequilibrium ld we explored the predicted effects on protein sequence using variant effect predictor vep 59 focusing on the nonsynonymous and splicesite snps as well as indels annotated in the 1kgp we explored effects on gene expression using regulome db annotations 60 gtex data 61 and basal root ganglion rnaseq data kindly provided by g gisselmann 62
 
to investigate the patterns of genetic diversity of trpm8 we used genomewide genotype data from the 1kgp phase iii 34 african ancestry esn esan in nigeria gwd gambian mandinka in western divisions in gambia yri yoruba in ibadan nigeria lwk luhya in webuye kenya msl mende in sierra leone asw african ancestry in southwest usa acb african caribbean in barbados european ancestry gbr british from england and scotland ceu utah residents usa with northern and western european ancestry fin finnish from finland tsi toscani in italia ibs iberian populations in spain east asian ancestry chs southern han chinese chb han chinese in beijing china jpt japanese in toyko japan cdx chinese dai in xishuangbanna china khv kinh in ho chi minh city vietnam south asian ancestry beb bengali in bangladesh gih gujarati indians in houston usa itu indian telugu in the uk pjl punjabi in lahore pakistan stu sri lankan tamil in the uk the american populations from the 1kgp have recent admixture with europeans 63 and thus are not suited for our analysis and were excluded across the twentytwo populations the lowest sample size is sixtyone asw so to minimise power differences among populations we randomly downsampled each population to sixtyone unrelated individuals
 
we also used the genetic data from the one hundred and fortytwo populations of the sgdp project dataset together with their metainformation including geographic location 41 for the geographic location in the southern hemisphere we used the absolute value of the latitude most populations have high coverage wholegenome sequencing data for two representative individuals so we used two individuals from each panel c population with a sample size of at least two 110 populations
 
ancient genomes were used to infer the frequency of rs10166942 t in different prehistoric human populations the genotype data from ancient paleoeskimo individuals from the saqqaq culture 64 were obtained from the danish bioinformatics center data on early europeans 42 was downloaded from the reich lab webpage we transformed the binary eigenstrat file to a vcf using eigenstrat2vcfpy and extracted the genotype information for rs10166942 age information was extracted from supplementary data one in 42 after filtering we were able to genotype seventynine ancient individuals for rs10166942 these individuals lived in eurasia 3000 to 8500 years ago and represent three different ancestry groups huntergatherers 8 individuals early farmers 33 individuals and steppe pastoralists 38 individuals
 
we inferred the likely place of origin for the rs10166942 t allele by analysing haplotypes carrying the derived t allele as levels of linked variation should be highest in the population closest to the one where it appeared since no homozygous tt individuals are present in several of the 1kgp populations we relied on the phased haplotypes across the 65kb region of interest we calculated pi after removing derived haplotypes with evidence of recombination with ancestral rs10166942 c allele s1 table
 
in order to investigate the correlation of allele frequencies with latitude and temperature we jointly analysed genetic latitude and temperature information for modern humans we estimated the absolute latitude of the location of each population according to wikipedia and google maps table 1 the ceu population of central european ancestry was assigned the coordinates of brussels for early modern humans latitude information was extracted from supplementary data one in 42 and updated when necessary eg some individuals lacked geographic coordinates or had problems with the longitudelatitude information
 
temperature time series information was extracted for 20012010 from a 05x05 grid matrix assembled at the climate research unit of the university of east anglia version 323 65 data is available since 1960 but we used only the time series from 20012010 to guarantee comparable and highquality estimates across populations using the geographic coordinates of each population we extracted annual mean temperatures
 
to investigate to what extent shared ancestry latitude and temperature predict rs10166942 t allele frequency in each population we used two different linear models we first used a pgls analysis 40 which can account for the full phylogenetic signal the population relationships present in our data 39 the response variable is the mean derived allele frequency of the rs10166942 t allele per population we first conducted a nullfull model comparison the null model contains only the shared ancestry information the phylogeny here we used the full pairwise fst matrix averaged across all positions polymorphic in that particular population pair following weir and cockerham we calculated the genomewide average fst between two populations as the ratio of averages equation ten in 49 a neighborjoining nj tree was calculated using a matrix of the pairwise fst values with the r package ape 66 and rooted using midpoint rooting with archaeopteryx 67 the full model includes additional predictor variables latitude and annual mean temperature in order to achieve convergence of the model we ztransformed each predictor we excluded populations one at a time and compared the model estimates derived from the subsets with those obtained from the full data set which revealed the model to have good stability we assessed for the full model whether the assumptions of normally distributed and homogenous residuals were fulfilled by visual inspection of a qqplot of the residuals and residuals plotted against fitted values 68 which revealed no issues with these assumptions as an overall test of the effect of the two test predictors latitude and annual mean temperature we compared the fit of the full model with that of the null model 69 using a likelihood ratio test 70
 
we then performed a multimodel inference 71 to compare the null model and all possible models that could be constructed with the two test predictors four models in total to quantify the relative performance of each model we used akaikes information criterion aic corrected for small samples as a measure of model fit penalized for model complexity and determined akaike weights as a measure of the support a model received compared to all other models in the set 71 in practice we use the akaike weights to derive the 95 best model confidence comprising the truly best model in the model set with a probability of 095 and also to determine akaike weights for the individual predictors by summing the akaike weights of the models comprising them to infer the overall relevance of predictors in the model set we determined whether the null model was included in the 95 best model confidence set 72 the analysis was conducted in r 73 using the function pgls of the package caper 74
 
to be able to analyze both the 1kgp and the sgdp datasets which has small sample size for a large number of populations so allele frequencies cannot be estimated we also used a glmm 75 fitted with binomial error structure and logit link function 76 this model conceptually corresponds to a regression however it allows more flexibility with regard to the distribution of the response eg normality and homogeneity of the residuals are not necessarily required and it also allows us to effectively control for nonindependence of the data due to multiple observations of the same populations or individuals 75 the response variable is the genotype of rs10166942 in each individual in a 2columnreponsematrix the derived and the ancestral allele counts for the modern human genetic data shared ancestry was controlled by adding as an additional fixed effect the genetic distance between each population and yri measured as the genomewide average fst population identity was included as a random effect in the model to account for random genetic drift we further included a random effect per individual to account for the nonindependence of the ancestral and derived allele counts the model that includes all these effects is the null model
 
to test for the effects of latitude and the annual mean temperature we included them as test predictor variables with fixed effects in the analysis of the early europeans we added age as a further test predictor variable for the comparison among models multi model inference 71 we considered the null model and all possible models that could be constructed with the two test predictors totaling four models eight in the early european analysis we assessed model stability as in case of the pgls which revealed the model to have good stability s3 table overdispersion was no issue dispersion parameter of the full model in the 1kgp zero point nine seven and the sgdp 067 the models were fitted in r 73 using the library lme4 77
 
local adaptation on a single variant can lead to a rapid rise in the frequency of the positively selected allele resulting in strong population differentiation measured for example by fst between the populations with positive selection and those without it we calculated per snp fst with a custom perl implementation of the weir and cockerham estimator 49 for each pairwise population comparison
 
the allele under positive selection will rise in frequency together with its background haplotype raising the frequency of linked alleles when the favoured allele is young eg under a classic selection from a denovo mutation model sdn hard sweep model this results in a signature of extended haplotype homozygosity to test for such signature we calculated ihs 45 and xpehh 44 using selscan with default parameters 78 for ihs we used snps with derived allele frequencies higher than 5 and lower than 95 for xpehh we used snps with derived allele frequency higher than 5 in the test population these filters follow previously established methods 79 and prevent signatures of extended ld to be broken by rare variants while still obtaining xpehh values for derived alleles fixed or nearly fixed in the test population for both analyses only sites with a high confidence inferred ancestral allele were used part of 1kgp genotype files recombination was estimated using the genetic map from hapmap project phase two 80
 
all three statistics were calculated genomewide and pvalues for snps of interest were calculated based on the empirical distribution since both tests are sensitive for positive selection the tail of the empirical distribution is enriched for the targets of positive selection our analysis is hypothesisdriven for the migraine risk allele in rs10166942 and thus no correction for multiple testing is required
 
to infer the selective history of the gene we used an approximate bayesian computation abc approach which allows us to assess the probability of different evolutionary models and their associated parameters 46 following 7 50 we compared the genomic observations to simulations under three models with parameters drawn from uniform u prior distributions these models are i sdn where the selected allele appeared as a single copy between 60000 and 30000 years ago tmutu30000 60000 years ago and was immediately advantageous with a selective coefficient that was allowed to differ between the african sau015 and the nonafrican snau055 populations ii selection on standing variation ssv where a previously neutral allele at a given starting frequency fselu020 became positively selected snau05 in the nonafrican population after the out of africa migration and before the europeanasian split 51000 to 21000 years ago tmutu21000 51000 years ago iii fully neutral model ntr where the allele appeared as in the sdn model tmutu30000 60000 years ago but was completely neutral
 
we ran one million simulations for each selection model and 100000 simulations for the neutral model using msms 81 each simulation comprised a stretch of one hundred and eightyfive kb with one hundred and twentytwo chromosomes of an african population 1 and a nonafrican population 2 population human demographic parameters followed the model inferred by gravel et al 82 and in each simulation we analyzed the african population with one nonafrican population in europe or asia to simulate the recombination hotspots across the locus we simulated extended regions with a length that corresponded to the local increase in recombination rate above the baseline recombination rate s12 fig these regions were then removed before calculating summary statistics such that they contribute recombination events but not mutation events to the data the baseline recombination rate was the mean recombination rate across the locus excluding the peaks based on a merged map from several 1kgp populations s12 fig
 
for the abc inference we used five summary statistics xpehh 44 fay and wus h 47 tajimas d 48 fst 49 and derivedallelefrequency xpehh and fst were calculated between yri and the studied population we calculated the ld based statistic xpehh on the selected allele using the entire simulated region we calculated the statistics fay and wus h tajimas d and average fst across snps in a section in both simulated populations on two separate sections the first section was the central 65 kb part since the genomic data shows strong population differentiation across sixtyfive kb and the second section were the combined flanking regions together one hundred and twenty kb long we also used the allele frequency of the selected site in the african and nonafrican population and its fst
 
as in the genomic data for the xpehh statistic we required the variant investigated to have a derived allele frequency  5 in the test nonafrican population the absence of a long haplotype associated with the derived allele xpehh in the presence of strong population differentiation is an important attribute to differentiate between the sdn and the ssv model 8385 thus we used only simulations where xpehh could be calculated which biased minimally the previously uniform prior
 
all summary statistics were calculated in the same way for the simulations and the real datawhere rs10166942 was used as a proxy for the selected site the demographic history follows the 82 model african demography was based on yri all european populations ceu gbr tsi fin ibs were simulated under the inferred european ceu demography and all asian populations cdx chb chs khv jpt beb gih itu pjl stu under the inferred east asian chbjpt demography the abc analysis was performed using the abctoolbox on boxcox and pls transformed summary statistics following recommendations for abctoolbox 86 retaining the top 1000 simulations matching our observation we used the first five pls components as they carried most information for each parameter s13 fig the pls transformed statistics differentiate between the different models and capture the variation observed s11 fig rendering them wellsuited for the inference
 
we performed an additional abc inference considering a halted sdn and a halted ssv model with all parameters as above with the only exception that selection ceased 3000 years ago both power estimates and model selection were performed as described above lastly we also performed an abc analysis with the four selection models sdn partial sdn ssv and partial ssv to test our power to discriminate among them
